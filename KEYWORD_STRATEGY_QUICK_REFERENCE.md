| Pillar Pages (2,000-3,000 words) | 0.4-0.9% | 5-8 | 4-8 to cluster posts |
| Tool Pages (400-800 words) | 0.8-1.5% | 2-3 | 1-2 |

## The 5 Red Flags of Over-Optimization

| Red Flag | What It Looks Like | Fix |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Every sentence has the keyword** | "Strata levy payment plans can help. Strata levy payment plans let you..." | Use LSI variations 50% of the time |

| **Repetitive anchor text** | Every link says "strata levy payment plans" | Vary: "payment options", "arrangements", "schedules" |
| **Hidden text** | White keywords on white background | Never do this (it's a Google penalty) |
