## Identified Issues & Recommendations

### ⚠️ Issue #1: Levy Payment Plans Cluster Assignment

**Current Status:** Blog post `/blog/strata-levy-payment-plans-nsw` is assigned to both potential pillars

**Recommendation:** Confirm it belongs primarily to `2025-nsw-strata-reforms` (it's about NEW 2025 assistance options) and add secondary link from financial-management pillar.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Verify pillar frontmatter assignment
- [ ] Ensure `/guides/2025-nsw-strata-reforms` links to all 4 reform posts
- [ ] Add cross-link in `/guides/strata-financial-management`

**Timeline:** Before next audit

### ⚠️ Issue #2: 2025 Reforms Cluster Monitoring

**Current Status:** New cluster (5 pages total) - needs first month of monitoring

**Recommendation:** Monitor all 5 keywords for first 30 days to validate assignments

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Track "2025 strata reforms nsw" ranking for pillar page
- [ ] Track all 4 blog post keywords in Google top 10
- [ ] Document any unexpected cannibalization in January 2026

**Timeline:** Monthly monitoring starting January 2026

### ⚠️ Issue #3: AGM Blog Post Positioning

**Current Status:** `/blog/how-to-run-agm-self-managed-strata` exists but pillar connection unclear

**Recommendation:** Clarify as child of `transition-to-self-managed` pillar with secondary link from compliance pillar

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update frontmatter: `pillar: "transition-to-self-managed"`
- [ ] Add link in transition-to-self-managed pillar page
- [ ] Add secondary link in compliance pillar

**Timeline:** This week

### ⚠️ Issue #4: Compliance Tool & Pillar Cross-Linking

**Current Status:** Tool and pillar are well-differentiated but could strengthen reciprocal linking

**Recommendation:** Add strategic cross-links to reinforce relationship and drive traffic between them

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add "Learn more" link in compliance tool
- [ ] Verify keywords remain differentiated

**Timeline:** When next updating pages
