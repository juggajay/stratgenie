## Overlap Assessment

### Calculate Keyword Overlap

**Primary keyword overlap with existing page:**
- Existing page: [page name]
- Shared keyword: [keyword]
- Estimated overlap: __% (0-100)

**Assessment:**
- [ ] 0-30% (Low risk) → Proceed
- [ ] 30-60% (Medium risk) → Differentiate
- [ ] 60-80% (High risk) → Differentiate or consolidate
- [ ] 80%+ (Critical) → Must consolidate

### Differentiation Potential

**Can you differentiate this content sufficiently?**

**Scoring Questions (1=No, 5=Yes):**

1. **Different search intent?** (informational vs. transactional vs. commercial)
   Score: __/5

2. **Different audience?** (self-managed vs. professional, new vs. experienced)
   Score: __/5

3. **Different content depth?** (overview vs. detailed, tool vs. educational)
   Score: __/5

4. **Different angle/perspective?** (how-to vs. legal vs. problem/solution)
   Score: __/5

**Total Score:** __/20

- **Score 15+:** Strong differentiation possible → Proceed with modifications
- **Score 10-14:** Differentiation possible with significant changes
- **Score <10:** Consolidation recommended → Do not proceed independently
