## 1. Writing Style Guide

### Brand Voice

**StrataGenie Tone:** Professional, helpful, empowering, trustworthy

- **Target Audience:** Volunteer strata committee members (non-technical)
- **Education Level:** Assume intelligent readers with no legal/strata background
- **Pain Points:** Compliance anxiety, time pressure, fear of making mistakes
- **Goal:** Make complex strata regulations feel manageable

### Core Principles

#### A. Clarity Over Complexity

**DO:**
- Use plain English
- Define legal terms on first use
- Break complex concepts into digestible chunks
- Use active voice

**DON'T:**
- Use legal jargon without explanation
- Write long, dense paragraphs (max 3-4 sentences)
- Assume prior knowledge
- Use passive voice unnecessarily

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: "The owners corporation is obligated to convene an annual general meeting pursuant to Section 17 of the SSMA 2015."

✅ Good: "Under NSW law, your strata scheme must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) once a year."

#### B. Authority with Accessibility

**DO:**
- Cite specific legislation when relevant
- Reference official sources (NSW Fair Trading, NCAT)
- Use precise terminology
- Demonstrate expertise

**DON'T:**
- Make claims without basis
- Use vague language ("usually", "often", "sometimes")
- Oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy
- Sound condescending

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: "You might need to do some training."

✅ Good: "While NSW Fair Trading offers free training modules for committee members, completing them isn't legally mandatory. However, trained committees make fewer costly mistakes and avoid personal liability."

#### C. Action-Oriented

**DO:**
- Give clear next steps
- Use imperative verbs
- Provide templates and checklists
- Focus on "how-to" over "what is"

**DON'T:**
- Leave readers uncertain about what to do
- Write purely informational content without guidance
- Bury the actionable advice
- Skip practical examples

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: "Strata Hub registration involves several steps."

✅ Good: "Visit the NSW Strata Hub website and create your account using your email address. You'll need to verify your identity as an authorized committee member."

### Writing Rules

#### Sentence Structure
- **Ideal sentence length:** 15-20 words

- **One idea per sentence**

#### Paragraph Structure
- **Ideal paragraph length:** 2-3 sentences
- **Maximum paragraph length:** 4 sentences
- **Each paragraph has one clear topic**
- **Use transition words** between paragraphs

#### Formatting
- **Bold** key concepts and important warnings
- *Italics* for emphasis (sparingly)
- `Code formatting` for numbers, dates, references
- Lists for multiple items (always use bullets or numbers)

#### Lists
- Use **numbered lists** for sequential steps or rankings
- Use **bullet points** for non-sequential items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Limit to 7±2 items per list (cognitive load)

## 2. Introduction Hook Templates

The first 2-3 sentences must capture attention and promise value. Choose one of these proven patterns:

### Template 1: Problem-Solution Hook

**Pattern:**
```
[Problem statement that resonates] + [Promise of solution] + [Brief context]
```

**Example:**
> Running your first Annual General Meeting as a self-managed strata scheme can feel daunting. This guide breaks down the entire process into manageable steps, ensuring your AGM is compliant and effective. By the end, you'll have a clear roadmap for conducting a professional meeting that satisfies NSW requirements.

**When to use:** Comprehensive how-to guides, process explanations

---

### Template 2: Authority-Urgency Hook

**Pattern:**
```
[New requirement/deadline] + [Why it matters] + [What this guide provides]
```

**Example:**
> If you're managing a strata scheme in NSW, registering with the Strata Hub is now mandatory. Failure to register or update your information can result in penalties of up to $2,200. This comprehensive guide walks you through everything you need to know about Strata Hub registration in 2025.

**When to use:** Compliance-focused content, deadline-driven topics

---

### Template 3: Confusion-Clarity Hook

**Pattern:**
```
[Common confusion/question] + [Why it's confusing] + [Promise of clarity]
```

**Example:**
> Understanding the difference between your administrative fund and capital works fund confuses many strata owners and committee members. While both are legally required, they serve completely different purposes—and mixing them is a compliance breach. This guide explains everything you need to know about strata levies in NSW.

**When to use:** Explainer articles, comparison content

---

### Template 4: Statistics-Stakes Hook

**Pattern:**
```
[Surprising statistic or fact] + [What it means for reader] + [What guide covers]
```

**Example:**
> Over 60% of strata schemes in NSW have underfunded capital works funds, putting them at risk of special levies and building degradation. Understanding how to properly fund and manage your scheme's two required funds is crucial for every committee member. This guide covers everything from basic calculations to avoiding common pitfalls.

**When to use:** Financial topics, risk management content

---

### Template 5: Empowerment Hook

**Pattern:**
```
[Reader's current state] + [Transformation promise] + [How guide delivers]
```

**Example:**
> The 2025 NSW strata reforms place greater emphasis on committee member accountability and competence. While this might sound intimidating, understanding your duties actually protects you from personal liability while helping you make better decisions. This guide breaks down the new requirements and shows you exactly what's expected.

**When to use:** Educational content, empowerment topics

```

#### Tables

```

```

## 4. Conclusion and CTA Frameworks

### Framework 1: Action-Focused Conclusion

**Pattern:**
```
[Summary of key points] + [Next immediate action] + [Product CTA] + [Legal disclaimer]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Next Steps

Running a compliant AGM doesn't have to be overwhelming. Focus on these priorities:

1. **Set your date** within 3 months of financial year end
2. **Prepare financials** at least 4 weeks before
3. **Send notices** 14+ days in advance
4. **Document everything** in your minutes

StrataGenie's AGM Assistant walks you through every step, from generating compliant notices to recording minutes. Our automated reminders ensure you never miss a critical deadline.

</LegalNote>
```

**When to use:** How-to guides, comprehensive tutorials

---

### Framework 2: Reassurance Conclusion

**Pattern:**
```
[Acknowledge challenge] + [Reframe as manageable] + [Offer support] + [CTA]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## You've Got This

The 2025 strata reforms might seem daunting at first, but they're designed to improve governance and protect committee members. By understanding your duties and accessing the right resources, you'll be well-equipped to serve your scheme effectively.

StrataGenie keeps you compliant with automated tracking of all new requirements, plain-English explanations of your obligations, and smart reminders for every deadline.

*This guide is part of our [2025 NSW Strata Reforms](/guides/2025-nsw-strata-reforms) series. For guidance on running your scheme, see our [Transition to Self-Managed Guide](/guides/transition-to-self-managed).*
```

**When to use:** Compliance updates, reform explanations, overwhelming topics

---

### Framework 3: Comparison Recap Conclusion

**Pattern:**
```
[Quick comparison recap] + [Key takeaway] + [Common mistake warning] + [Product benefit] + [CTA]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## The Bottom Line

The administrative fund covers your day-to-day expenses, while the capital works fund protects your building's long-term value. Both are legally required, must be kept in separate accounts, and need proper planning to avoid special levies.

The most common mistake? Underfunding your capital works fund to keep quarterly levies low. This short-term thinking leads to financial shocks when major work becomes unavoidable.

StrataGenie's financial planning tools help you calculate sustainable levies, build compliant 10-year capital works plans, and track both funds with automatic reporting.

```

**When to use:** Explainer articles, comparison content

---

### Framework 4: Deadline-Driven Conclusion

**Pattern:**
```
[Deadline recap] + [Urgency statement] + [Immediate action items] + [CTA with urgency]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Don't Miss the Deadline

All NSW strata schemes must register on the Strata Hub. Late registration can result in penalties of up to $2,200, and you're required to keep your information updated annually.

**Take action today:**
1. Gather your scheme documents (SP number, committee details, insurance)
2. Visit the NSW Strata Hub website
3. Complete registration (15-30 minutes)
4. Set annual reminders for updates

StrataGenie syncs with the Strata Hub automatically, ensuring your registration stays current without manual updates. Never worry about compliance again.

<TrialCTA />
```

**When to use:** Deadline-focused content, mandatory compliance topics

---

### CTA Component Usage

**Primary CTA: TrialCTA**
```mdx
<TrialCTA />
```

**Placement:**
- Once per article
- After "How StrataGenie Helps" section
- Before FAQ section or at very end
- Never in introduction

**Product Integration Rules:**

**DO:**
- Show specific features that solve the article's problem
- Use benefit-focused language
- Keep it brief (3-4 bullet points max)
- Place naturally in flow

**DON'T:**

- Use generic marketing speak

2. **Transition to Self-Managed** (`transition-to-self-managed`)
   - Hub: Ultimate guide to self-managing your strata
   - Clusters: First AGM, committee duties, when to hire help

3. **Strata Financial Management** (`strata-financial-management`)
   - Hub: Complete financial guide for strata committees
   - Clusters: Admin vs capital funds, levy setting, budgeting, debt recovery

4. **2025 NSW Strata Reforms** (`2025-nsw-strata-reforms`)
