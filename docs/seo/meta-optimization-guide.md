## URL Structure Guidelines

### Core Principles

- **Lowercase** – always lowercase, no uppercase
- **Hyphens only** – separate words with hyphens, never underscores
- **Readable** – humans should understand the page at a glance
- **Consistent depth** – avoid excessive nesting (max 3 levels for content)
- **No parameters** – avoid query strings in main URLs
- **Short** – ideally under 75 characters

### URL Architecture Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Marketing Pages (Root + Section)

```
/[section]
/[section]/[page]
```

**Examples:**
```
/tools
/tools/levy-calculator
/tools/compliance-health-check
/guides
/guides/agm-compliance-2025
/guides/nsw-strata-reforms
```

#### Pattern 2: Blog/Content

```
/blog
/blog/[year]/[month]/[slug]
/blog/category/[category]
```

**Examples:**
```
/blog/2025/01/agm-notice-requirements
/blog/2025/01/strata-hub-registration
/blog/category/compliance
/blog/category/financial-management
```

#### Pattern 3: Dynamic Pages (Location, Suburb)

```
/[service]/[location]
```

**Examples:**
```
/strata-management/bondi
/strata-management/surry-hills
/strata-management/manly
```

#### Pattern 4: Agents/Products

```
/agents/[agent-name]
/products/[product-name]
```

**Examples:**
```
/agents/secretary
/agents/treasurer
/agents/guardian
/agents/postman
```

#### Pattern 5: Legal/Meta

```
/privacy
/terms
/contact
/sitemap.xml
/robots.txt
```

### URL Slug Naming Conventions

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Blog Post** | `[verb]-[noun]-[specificity]-[year]` | `how-to-run-agm-2025` |
| **Guide** | `[main-topic]-[subtopic]` | `strata-financial-management` |
| **Tool** | `[noun]-[tool-type]` | `levy-calculator` |
| **Category** | `[plural-noun]` | `guides`, `tools`, `agents` |
| **Location** | `[suburb-or-area]` | `sydney-cbd`, `north-shore` |

### URL Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

1. **Keyword-rich slug** – include main keyword (e.g., `agm-compliance-2025` not `article-123`)
2. **Avoid stop words** – remove "the," "a," "and" where possible
3. **Static URLs** – once published, never change (redirects required)
4. **Consistent protocol** – always use HTTPS, www or non-www (pick one)
5. **No date aging** – unless date is essential to content (evergreen content: no date)
6. **No duplicate content** – avoid similar URLs with different parameters
7. **Descriptive** – if read aloud, should make sense

## Compliance & Best Practices

### Google Search Quality Guidelines

1. **Accuracy** – Titles and descriptions must match page content
2. **No clickbait** – Avoid misleading titles or descriptions
3. **No keyword stuffing** – Max 2 primary keywords per element
4. **No special characters** – Stick to ASCII; avoid excessive symbols
5. **Unique per page** – Never duplicate titles/descriptions
6. **Mobile-friendly** – Test truncation on mobile (120 chars desc, 35 chars title)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| "Home" as title | Too generic, no keywords | "StrataGenie \| AI Strata Compliance" |
| "Welcome to our site" | Clickbait-y, vague | Lead with value proposition |
| Exact keyword repeat (3x) | Keyword stuffing | Use variations (strata, scheme, committee) |
| No CTA in description | Low engagement | Add "Start free," "Learn more," "Try now" |
| Same description on 5 pages | Duplicate content issues | Unique per page |
| Emoji overuse | Truncation, readability | Stick to text |
| Special chars: €, ™, ® | Font/encoding issues | Use plain ASCII |
