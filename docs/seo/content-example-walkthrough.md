## Step 6: Write the Body Content

### Example Section: Step 3 - Estimate Useful Life

```markdown
### Step 3: Estimate Useful Life

Once you've identified all building components and assessed their condition, determine the expected useful life for each item. This tells you when replacement or major maintenance will be needed.

#### Using Industry Standards

The table below shows typical useful lives for common building components:

| Component | Useful Life | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| External painting | 10-15 years | Varies by exposure to weather |
| Roof (tile) | 40-60 years | Individual tiles may need replacement |
| Roof (metal) | 30-40 years | Check for rust annually |
| Lift | 20-25 years | Major overhaul at 15 years |
| Hot water system | 10-15 years | Regular servicing extends life |
| Intercom system | 15-20 years | Technology changes may force earlier upgrade |
| Fire panel | 15-20 years | Compliance requirements evolving |

<Tip>
These are estimates only. Your actual useful life depends on the component's quality, maintenance history, and environmental factors.
</Tip>

#### Adjusting for Your Building

Consider these factors when adjusting standard lifespans:

**Building Age**
- Older buildings often have higher-quality materials (longer life)
- Modern buildings may use cheaper materials (shorter life)

**Maintenance History**
- Well-maintained items last longer
- Deferred maintenance shortens remaining life

**Environmental Factors**
- Coastal locations: reduce metal component life by 20-30%
- High sun exposure: reduce painting life by 20%
- Heavy use areas: reduce carpet, lifts by 15-20%

#### Calculating Remaining Life

For existing components, calculate remaining useful life:

```
Remaining Life = Total Useful Life - Current Age - Condition Adjustment
```

**Example:**
- Roof is 25 years old
- Standard life: 40 years
- Current condition: Fair (subtract 5 years)
- Remaining life: 40 - 25 - 5 = 10 years

<Info>
Document your assumptions. Future committees need to understand how you determined each lifespan estimate.
</Info>

Once you have remaining useful life for each component, you can schedule when replacement will be needed in your 10-year plan.
```

## Step 7: Write Common Mistakes Section

```markdown
## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even with the best intentions, many committees make these mistakes when creating their capital works plan:

### 1. Significantly Underestimating Costs

**The mistake:** Using outdated costs or rough guesses instead of getting actual quotes.

**Why it happens:** Getting quotes takes time, and committees want to finish the plan quickly.

**The consequence:** When work is actually needed, there's insufficient funds, forcing a special levy on owners.

**How to prevent:** Get at least three quotes for major items. For distant items (8+ years away), use industry cost guides with 3-4% annual inflation.

### 2. Ignoring "Small" Items

**The mistake:** Only including major items like roof and painting, ignoring items under $5,000.

**Why it happens:** Committees think small items can be covered by the admin fund.

**The consequence:** Multiple small items in one year can exceed the admin budget, or the capital works fund is depleted by items that should have been planned.

**How to prevent:** Include everything expected to cost over $1,000. Yes, even replacement of 6 car park lights is a capital item if it's a planned replacement.

<Warning>
The definition of capital works isn't about dollar value—it's about whether the work is planned maintenance versus emergency repair. Include all planned work.
</Warning>

### 3. Forgetting Inflation

**The mistake:** Using today's costs for work planned in 8 years.

**Why it happens:** It seems conservative to use current prices.

**The consequence:** Severe underfunding. A $50,000 paint job in 2025 will cost $65,000-$70,000 in 2033.

**How to prevent:** Apply annual inflation of 3-4% for construction costs (higher than general CPI).

### 4. Creating the Plan Then Never Updating It

**The mistake:** Completing the plan, presenting it at an AGM, then filing it away forever.

**Why it happens:** Committees change, and new members don't know the plan exists.

**The consequence:** After several years, the plan is useless—costs are outdated, completed work isn't removed, new issues aren't added.

**How to prevent:**
- Review the plan at every AGM
- Update costs annually
- Remove completed items
- Add newly identified work
- Full revision every 5 years (legal requirement)

<Danger>
A badly outdated plan is worse than no plan. It gives false confidence about financial readiness while reality has diverged completely.
</Danger>

## Step 9: Write FAQ Section

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is a 10-year capital works plan legally required?

Yes. Under Section 80 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015, every owners corporation in NSW must prepare and maintain a 10-year capital works fund plan. The plan must be reviewed at each AGM and fully updated at least every 5 years.

### Do two-lot schemes need a capital works plan?

Yes. The requirement applies to all strata schemes in NSW, regardless of size. Even a duplex must have a 10-year capital works plan, though it will typically be simpler than a large building's plan.

### Can we use the same plan for years without updating?

No. You must review the plan annually at your AGM and update it every 5 years at minimum. However, best practice is to update costs annually and adjust for completed work or newly identified issues.

### What happens if we don't have a capital works plan?

Operating without a proper capital works plan is a compliance breach that must be reported to NSW Fair Trading via the Strata Hub. More practically, you risk unexpected special levies and building deterioration from lack of planning.

### Should we hire a professional to create our plan?

For buildings over 3 stories or schemes with more than 10 lots, professional input is highly recommended. A building consultant can identify issues you might miss and provide accurate cost estimates. Smaller schemes can often prepare their own plan using templates and industry guides.

### How much should be in our capital works fund?

There's no single answer—it depends on your building's age, condition, and upcoming work. Your 10-year plan shows exactly how much you need. Generally, funds should be building toward the next major expense (like painting) with something in reserve for unexpected major repairs.

A compliant 10-year capital works plan is essential for maintaining your building's value and avoiding surprise special levies. While creating your first plan takes effort, the process becomes easier with each annual review.

**Start today:**

1. **Gather your documents** - Building plans, past maintenance records, current fund balance
2. **Identify all components** - Use the checklist in Step 1 as your starting point
3. **Get quotes for major items** - At least 3 quotes for work planned in the next 3 years
4. **Build your schedule** - Use our formula to calculate required annual contributions
5. **Present at your AGM** - Show owners the long-term plan and funding strategy

Remember: A capital works plan isn't created once and forgotten. It's a living document that should evolve with your building's needs. Set a calendar reminder for annual reviews, and your scheme will be well-prepared for future maintenance.

StrataGenie's Capital Works Planning module does the heavy lifting for you—from component checklists to automatic inflation calculations. Spend your time making decisions, not building spreadsheets.
