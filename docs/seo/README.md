## Common Questions

### Q: Do we really need technical reviewers for every article?
**A:** Yes, for YMYL content (legal, financial, compliance). Non-YMYL content (like "Committee Meeting Tips") can be author-verified only.

### Q: What if we can't find credentialed authors for all topics?
**A:** Either:
1. Partner with external experts (guest contributors)
2. Hire consultants for specific reviews
3. Delay content until proper expertise is available
Never publish YMYL content without proper credentials.

### Q: How do we handle content about states where we don't have licensed experts?
**A:** Three options:
1. Partner with licensed professionals in those states
2. Clearly label content as "general information" with strong disclaimers
3. Focus on federal/general content until state expertise is available

### Q: What's the minimum word count for different content types?
**A:**
- Beginner/Foundation: 1,200-1,800 words
- Intermediate: 1,800-2,500 words
- Advanced/Expert: 2,500+ words
- Pillar pages: 3,000+ words

Always prioritize depth and quality over hitting word counts.

### Q: How quickly should we respond to regulatory changes?
**A:**
- Flag affected content: Within 24 hours
- Update content and citations: Within 48 hours
- Publish change summary article: Within 1 week
- Comprehensive review: Monthly for high-impact changes

### Q: Can we repurpose competitor content?
**A:** No. All content must be original. You can:
- Cover same topics (with better depth and E-E-A-T)
- Reference competitors as sources (with attribution)
- Analyze competitor approaches in comparison guides
Never copy or closely paraphrase competitor content.
