# Financial Hardship Information Statement: New NSW Strata Requirement

As of **1 October 2025**, every levy notice issued by an NSW strata scheme must include a **Financial Hardship Information Statement**. This new requirement is part of the 2025 NSW strata reforms designed to support lot owners experiencing financial difficulty.

## What is the Financial Hardship Information Statement?

The Financial Hardship Information Statement is a prescribed document that informs lot owners of their rights to:

- Request a payment plan if they're experiencing financial hardship
- Seek assistance before their levies become significantly overdue
- Understand the process for negotiating alternative payment arrangements

The statement must be attached to or included with every levy notice, regardless of whether the owner has previously received one.

## Why Was This Introduced?

The NSW Government recognised that:

1. **Economic pressures** are affecting many lot owners' ability to pay levies on time
2. **Early intervention** prevents small arrears from becoming unmanageable debts
3. **Transparency** about owner rights reduces disputes and NCAT applications
4. **Fairness** requires that all owners know their options before facing debt recovery

## What Must the Statement Include?

The Financial Hardship Information Statement must contain:

### Mandatory Elements

- A clear statement that owners can request a payment plan
- Information about who to contact (secretary or strata manager)
- A reference to the relevant legislation
- Advice to seek financial counselling if needed

### Recommended Inclusions

- Your scheme's specific contact details
- Timeframes for responding to requests
- A link or reference to further information

## How to Comply

### Step 1: Obtain the Prescribed Form

NSW Fair Trading provides a template Financial Hardship Information Statement. You can:

- Download it from the Fair Trading website
- Use StrataGenie's automatically generated compliant notices
- Adapt the template to include your scheme's specific contact details

### Step 2: Update Your Levy Notice Process

If you generate levy notices manually:

1. Add the statement as an attachment to every notice
2. Ensure it's included even for owners who are up to date
3. Keep records showing the statement was provided

If you use accounting software:

1. Update your notice templates
2. Test that the statement prints with every notice
3. Verify the format is readable and complete

### Step 3: Train Your Committee

Ensure all committee members understand:

- Why the statement is required
- How to respond to payment plan requests (covered in our [payment plans guide](/blog/strata-levy-payment-plans-nsw))
- Documentation requirements

## What Happens If You Don't Comply?

Non-compliance with the Financial Hardship Information Statement requirement may:

### Affect Levy Recovery

If you pursue an owner for unpaid levies through NCAT, they may argue that proper notice wasn't given. This could delay or complicate recovery action.

### Result in Complaints

Owners may lodge complaints with NSW Fair Trading if they weren't informed of their rights, potentially triggering an investigation.

### Create Disputes

Lack of transparency can lead to owner disputes and damaged relationships within the scheme.

## Sample Financial Hardship Information Statement

Here's an example of what your statement might look like:

---

**FINANCIAL HARDSHIP INFORMATION STATEMENT**

*Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW)*

If you are experiencing financial hardship and are having difficulty paying your strata levies, you have the right to request a payment plan from the owners corporation.

**To request a payment plan:**

Contact the Secretary at [email/phone] or write to [address].

Your request will be considered at the next committee meeting, or within 14 days if urgent.

**Further assistance:**

- NSW Fair Trading: fairtrading.nsw.gov.au
- National Debt Helpline: 1800 007 007
- Financial counselling services in your area

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do we need to include this for owners who are up to date?

Yes. The statement must accompany every levy notice, regardless of the owner's payment history.

### Can we email the statement or must it be printed?

If you issue levy notices electronically (with the owner's consent), the statement can be included electronically. It should be clearly visible, not buried in terms and conditions.

### What if our strata manager handles levy notices?

Your strata manager should already be updating their processes. However, as the owners corporation, you're ultimately responsible for compliance. Confirm with your manager that their notices include the statement.

### Does this apply to special levies too?

Yes. Any notice requiring payment of levies—whether quarterly levies, special levies, or arrears notices—must include the statement.

## Next Steps

1. **Download** the Fair Trading template or use StrataGenie's compliant notices
2. **Update** your levy notice process immediately
3. **Notify** all committee members of the new requirement
4. **Review** your payment plan policy (see our [payment plans guide](/blog/strata-levy-payment-plans-nsw))
