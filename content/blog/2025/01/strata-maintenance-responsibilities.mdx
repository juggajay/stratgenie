One of the most common sources of disputes in strata schemes is maintenance responsibility. Who fixes a leaking balcony? What about a blocked drain? This guide clarifies maintenance responsibilities in NSW strata schemes.

## The Basic Principle

In NSW strata schemes, there's a fundamental division:

- **Owners Corporation** - Responsible for common property
- **Lot Owner** - Responsible for their lot

Sounds simple, right? The complexity arises in defining exactly what constitutes "common property" versus "lot property."

<Info>
The boundaries of your lot are defined in your strata plan. When in doubt, always check the registered plan.
</Info>

## What is Common Property?

Common property includes all parts of the strata scheme that are not within individual lots:

### Structural Elements

- External walls (outside face)
- Roof and roof structure
- Building foundations
- Load-bearing walls
- Common stairwells and corridors
- Lift shafts and lifts
- Fire stairs and fire safety systems

### Shared Facilities

- Swimming pools
- Gymnasiums
- Gardens and landscaping
- Driveways and car park areas (excluding allocated spaces in some cases)
- Foyers and lobbies
- Laundry facilities

### Building Services

- Main water pipes (up to the lot boundary)
- Main sewer pipes
- Main electrical wiring
- Common area lighting
- Security systems
- Intercom systems

## What is Lot Property?

Individual lot owners are responsible for:

### Inside the Lot

- Internal walls (non-structural)
- Internal paintwork and finishes
- Flooring and floor coverings
- Kitchen and bathroom fixtures
- Built-in appliances
- Internal doors

### Connected Items

- Hot water system (if individual to lot)
- Air conditioning units (often)
- Window coverings
- Personal modifications or additions

<Warning>
Some items like air conditioners and hot water systems may be common property depending on your scheme's configuration and strata plan. Always verify.
</Warning>

## The Grey Areas

Many maintenance issues fall into grey areas. Here's how to approach them:

### Balconies

| Component | Typically Responsible |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Structural slab | Owners Corporation |
| Waterproof membrane | Owners Corporation |
| Tiles/surface finish | Often Lot Owner (check bylaws) |
| Balcony railing | Owners Corporation |
| Balcony ceiling | Owners Corporation |

### Windows

| Component | Typically Responsible |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Window frame | Owners Corporation |
| Window glass | Usually Owners Corporation |
| Window locks | Check bylaws |
| Fly screens | Often Lot Owner |
| Curtains/blinds | Lot Owner |

### Plumbing

| Component | Typically Responsible |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Main stack/riser | Owners Corporation |
| Pipes within walls | Usually Owners Corporation |
| Fixtures (taps, toilets) | Lot Owner |
| Blocked drains (within lot) | Lot Owner |
| Blocked main sewer | Owners Corporation |

<Tip>
If a pipe serves only your lot but is within a wall or floor, it's likely common property. If it's visible within your lot and connects to your fixtures, it's likely lot property.
</Tip>

## Water Damage Scenarios

Water damage is one of the most contentious maintenance issues:

### Scenario 1: Leak from Upstairs Lot

**Cause:** Faulty fixture in upper lot
**Responsibility:** Upper lot owner for source repair; may be liable for damage to lower lot

### Scenario 2: Leak Through Balcony

**Cause:** Failed waterproof membrane
**Responsibility:** Owners Corporation for membrane repair; may share with lot owner if tile damage caused failure

### Scenario 3: Roof Leak

**Cause:** Damaged roofing
**Responsibility:** Owners Corporation for repair

### Scenario 4: Burst Pipe in Wall

**Cause:** Pipe failure
**Responsibility:** Owners Corporation for pipe repair; damage repair depends on cause

<Danger>
Water damage should be addressed immediately to prevent further deterioration. Document everything with photos and timestamps.
</Danger>

## Special Cases

### Boundary Walls

Walls between lots are typically common property if they're structural. Non-structural partition walls may be lot property or shared.

### Courtyards and Gardens

Even if a courtyard is for exclusive use by one lot, the underlying structure is usually common property. Check your bylaws for maintenance responsibility.

### Car Spaces

- Visitor parking: Common property
- Allocated spaces: Check strata plan—may be lot property or common property with exclusive use

## The Maintenance Process

### For Common Property

1. **Report the Issue** - Notify the strata committee or secretary
2. **Assessment** - Committee assesses the problem
3. **Quotes** - Obtain quotes if needed
4. **Approval** - Committee or owners approve works (depending on cost)
5. **Works Completed** - Contractor performs repairs
6. **Payment** - Paid from administrative or capital works fund

### For Lot Property

1. **Identify the Issue** - Determine if it's lot or common property
2. **Check Bylaws** - Some lots may need approval for modifications
3. **Engage Contractor** - Lot owner arranges and pays
4. **Complete Works** - Ensure compliance with building standards

<Info>
Even for lot property repairs, you may need owners corporation approval if the work affects common property, external appearance, or building structure.
</Info>

## Bylaws and Maintenance

Your scheme's bylaws may modify standard maintenance responsibilities. Common bylaw provisions include:

- Lot owners responsible for balcony tiles
- Lot owners responsible for garden bed maintenance
- Exclusive use areas maintenance allocation
- Air conditioner installation and maintenance rules

**Always check your bylaws** before assuming standard rules apply.

## Insurance Considerations

### Building Insurance (Owners Corporation)

Covers:

- Common property damage
- Building structure
- Lot fixtures (in most policies)
- Public liability on common property

### Contents Insurance (Lot Owner)

Covers:

- Personal belongings
- Unfixed items
- Alternative accommodation if displaced

### Excess and Claims

When damage occurs, understand:

- Who lodges the claim
- Who pays the excess
- Whether recovery from a responsible party is possible

<Warning>
Document all damage thoroughly before repairs begin. Take photos, keep records of communications, and obtain written quotes.
</Warning>

## Dispute Resolution

If there's disagreement about maintenance responsibility:

1. **Check the Strata Plan** - Clarify boundaries
2. **Review Bylaws** - Check for specific provisions
3. **Committee Discussion** - Attempt informal resolution
4. **General Meeting** - Raise at owners meeting
5. **Mediation** - Through NSW Fair Trading
6. **NCAT** - NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal for binding decisions
