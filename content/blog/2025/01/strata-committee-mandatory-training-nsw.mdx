# Strata Committee Training NSW: New Accountability Rules for 2025

The 2025 NSW strata reforms place greater emphasis on committee member accountability and competence. While training isn't strictly mandatory, the reforms create strong incentives for committee members to understand their obligations—and consequences for those who don't.

## What's Changed in 2025?

The reforms enhance committee accountability through:

### Enhanced Duties

- **Duty of care**: Committee members must act with reasonable care and diligence
- **Duty of disclosure**: Conflicts of interest must be declared promptly
- **Duty of good faith**: Decisions must be made in the scheme's best interests
- **Duty to comply**: Members should be aware of legal requirements

### Training Availability

NSW Fair Trading now provides:

- Free online training modules for committee members
- Specific guidance on the 2025 reforms
- Resources for self-managed schemes
- Regular updates on legislative changes

### Accountability Mechanisms

- Clearer grounds for removal of committee members
- Enhanced dispute resolution pathways
- Potential personal liability for serious breaches
- Greater NCAT powers to intervene

## Is Training Mandatory?

Technically, no—there's no legal requirement to complete training before serving on a strata committee. However:

### Strong Incentives to Train

1. **Personal protection**: Understanding your duties helps avoid personal liability
2. **Better decisions**: Trained committees make fewer costly mistakes
3. **Fewer disputes**: Knowledge reduces conflicts with owners
4. **Compliance**: Training covers the new 2025 requirements

### Practical Expectation

While not mandatory, committees that fail to understand basic obligations may face:

- Successful challenges to their decisions
- Complaints to Fair Trading
- NCAT orders to undertake training
- Personal liability claims

## Committee Member Duties Explained

### Duty of Care

You must act with the care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise:

**What this means:**
- Read meeting papers before meetings
- Ask questions if you don't understand
- Seek professional advice when needed
- Don't approve things you haven't reviewed

**Example breach:**
Approving a $50,000 contract without reading it or seeking quotes

### Duty of Disclosure

You must declare any conflicts of interest:

**What this means:**
- Disclose if you have a personal interest in a decision
- Declare relationships with contractors
- Abstain from voting on conflicted matters
- Record declarations in minutes

**Example breach:**
Voting to hire your brother-in-law's company without disclosure

### Duty of Good Faith

You must act in the best interests of the owners corporation:

**What this means:**
- Prioritise the scheme's interests over personal interests
- Consider all owners, not just your own lot
- Make decisions based on proper information
- Avoid using your position for personal gain

**Example breach:**
Pushing through a by-law change that only benefits your lot

### Duty to Comply

You should ensure the scheme meets its legal obligations:

**What this means:**
- Understand key compliance requirements
- Ensure meetings are properly held
- Maintain required records
- Meet statutory deadlines

**Example breach:**
Failing to hold an AGM for two years

## Creating a Training Culture

Self-managed schemes should encourage ongoing committee education:

### Induction for New Members

When someone joins the committee:

1. Provide key documents (by-laws, recent minutes, budget)
2. Explain current issues and priorities
3. Share Fair Trading training links
4. Assign a mentor from experienced members

### Regular Updates

Keep the committee informed:

- Share relevant Fair Trading newsletters
- Discuss legislative changes at meetings
- Review this blog for updates
- Consider annual refresher training

### Documentation

Maintain records showing:

- Training completed by each member
- Resources provided
- Topics covered at meetings
- Professional advice obtained

## Consequences of Poor Governance

### For the Scheme

- Invalid decisions that must be redone
- Financial losses from poor choices
- Disputes and legal costs
- Owner dissatisfaction

### For Individual Members

- Removal from committee by NCAT
- Personal liability for negligent decisions
- Reputational damage within the community
- Potential legal action from owners

## Self-Assessment: Are You Meeting Standards?

Ask yourself these questions:

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| I understand the scheme's by-laws | ☐ | ☐ |
| I read papers before meetings | ☐ | ☐ |
| I declare conflicts of interest | ☐ | ☐ |
| I know key compliance deadlines | ☐ | ☐ |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can owners force committee members to do training?

Not directly, but owners can:
- Pass a resolution encouraging training
- Raise concerns at the AGM
- Apply to NCAT if governance is failing
- Vote for different committee members

### What if I don't have time for training?

Fair Trading's online modules can be completed at your own pace. Consider whether you have capacity to serve on the committee if you can't invest a few hours in training.

### Does training protect me from liability?

Completing training demonstrates you're taking your duties seriously. While it doesn't guarantee immunity from liability, it shows good faith and helps you avoid mistakes.

### Is there training specific to self-managed schemes?

Yes. Fair Trading provides resources specifically for schemes without strata managers, covering the additional responsibilities this involves.
