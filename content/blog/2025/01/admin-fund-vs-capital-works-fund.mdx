Understanding strata levies is crucial for every lot owner and committee member. In NSW, strata schemes are required to maintain two separate funds: the Administrative Fund and the Capital Works Fund. This guide explains everything you need to know about each.

## Overview of Strata Funds

Under the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW), every owners corporation must establish and maintain:

1. **Administrative Fund** - For day-to-day expenses
2. **Capital Works Fund** - For major repairs and long-term maintenance

<Info>
Both funds must be kept in separate bank accounts. Mixing funds is a compliance breach.
</Info>

## The Administrative Fund

### What It Covers

The administrative fund covers regular, recurring expenses such as:

- Building insurance premiums
- Common area electricity and water
- Cleaning services
- Garden maintenance
- Minor repairs and maintenance
- Strata management fees
- Audit fees
- Bank charges

### How Levies Are Calculated

Administrative levies are typically calculated annually based on:

1. **Projected Expenses** - Estimated costs for the coming year
2. **Unit Entitlement** - Your lot's share of total entitlements

The formula is:

```
Your Levy = (Your Unit Entitlement / Total Entitlements) × Total Budget
```

### Typical Levy Ranges

| Scheme Size | Quarterly Admin Levy (per lot) |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Small (2-10 lots) | $300 - $800 |
| Medium (11-50 lots) | $500 - $1,200 |
| Large (51+ lots) | $600 - $2,000 |

<Tip>
These are indicative ranges only. Your actual levy depends on your building's specific expenses and your lot's unit entitlement.
</Tip>

## The Capital Works Fund

### What It Covers

The capital works fund covers major expenses and long-term maintenance:

- Building repainting (every 10-15 years)
- Roof replacement or major repairs
- Lift upgrades or replacement
- Fire safety system upgrades
- Waterproofing and structural repairs
- Window and facade work
- Driveway and carpark resurfacing

### The 10-Year Capital Works Plan

NSW law requires every strata scheme to have a 10-year capital works plan that:

- Identifies all major building components
- Estimates their useful life
- Projects replacement costs
- Sets a funding schedule

<Warning>
Schemes without a proper capital works plan risk special levies and potential building degradation.
</Warning>

### How Capital Works Levies Work

Capital works levies are calculated based on the 10-year plan projections:

1. **Identify Future Costs** - Total expected capital works over 10 years
2. **Apply Inflation** - Adjust for construction cost increases
3. **Divide by Years** - Calculate annual funding requirement
4. **Allocate by Entitlement** - Split based on unit entitlements

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Administrative Fund | Capital Works Fund |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Purpose | Day-to-day operations | Major repairs & long-term maintenance |
| Timeframe | Annual budgeting | 10-year planning |
| Typical Items | Insurance, cleaning, utilities | Painting, roof, lifts |
| Fund Balance | May vary year to year | Should steadily grow |
| Legal Requirement | Yes | Yes (with 10-year plan) |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Underfunding the Capital Works Fund

Many schemes set capital works levies too low to keep quarterly costs down. This leads to:

- Special levies when major work is needed
- Deferred maintenance causing worse damage
- Reduced property values

### 2. Using Capital Works for Admin Expenses

Transferring capital works funds to cover admin shortfalls is a compliance breach and depletes your long-term reserves.

### 3. Not Updating the 10-Year Plan

Building costs increase. Your plan should be reviewed annually and updated every 5 years at minimum.

<Danger>
Failing to maintain adequate capital works funding can result in penalties and personal liability for committee members.
</Danger>

## Special Levies

When unexpected major expenses arise and the capital works fund is insufficient, the committee may need to raise a special levy.

### How Special Levies Work

1. Committee identifies the funding gap
2. Special levy is proposed at a general meeting
3. Owners vote on the levy (ordinary resolution)
4. Levy is distributed based on unit entitlements
5. Payment terms are set (lump sum or instalments)

<Info>
Proper capital works planning minimizes the need for special levies, which can be financially stressful for lot owners.
</Info>

## Calculating Your Fair Share

Your levy contribution is based on your **unit entitlement**, which is set in the strata plan and typically reflects:

- Lot size (square meters)
- Lot type (apartment, townhouse, car space)
- Property value at registration

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Total scheme budget: $50,000/year
- Your unit entitlement: 15
- Total scheme entitlements: 200

**Your annual levy:**
```
$50,000 × (15/200) = $3,750/year
= $937.50/quarter
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we combine the two funds?

No. NSW law requires separate bank accounts for each fund. Combining funds is a compliance breach.

### How often should levies be reviewed?

Levies should be reviewed annually at the AGM based on projected expenses and the capital works plan.

### What if an owner doesn't pay their levies?

The owners corporation can charge interest on overdue levies and pursue debt recovery, including registering the debt on the property title.

### Do commercial lots pay different levies?

Levies are based on unit entitlements, not lot use. However, commercial lots may have higher entitlements reflecting their size or value.
