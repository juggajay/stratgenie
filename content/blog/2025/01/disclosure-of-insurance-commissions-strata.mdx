# Disclosure of Insurance Commissions in Strata: 2025 NSW Transparency Laws

The 2025 NSW strata reforms introduce significant new transparency requirements for insurance arrangements. Insurance brokers and strata managers must now disclose all commissions, fees, and potential conflicts of interest to lot owners.

## Why This Matters

Strata insurance is a significant expense—often one of the largest line items in a scheme's budget. Yet historically, owners have had limited visibility into:

- How much commission brokers receive
- Whether strata managers receive referral fees
- The true cost comparison between different insurers
- Potential conflicts of interest influencing recommendations

The 2025 reforms address these concerns by requiring full transparency.

## What Must Be Disclosed?

### Insurance Broker Disclosures

Brokers arranging strata insurance must disclose:

| Disclosure | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Commission rate** | Percentage or dollar amount received from insurer |
| **Volume bonuses** | Any additional payments based on total business placed |
| **Soft benefits** | Trips, gifts, or other non-cash benefits |
| **Fee structure** | Any fees charged to the scheme in addition to commission |
| **Insurer relationships** | Any ownership or exclusive arrangements |

### Strata Manager Disclosures

If a strata manager is involved in insurance arrangements, they must disclose:

| Disclosure | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Referral fees** | Payments received for referring business |
| **Commission sharing** | Any portion of broker commission received |
| **Related parties** | If the broker is a related company |
| **Alternative quotes** | Whether independent quotes were obtained |

### Timing of Disclosure

Disclosures must be made:

- **Before renewal**: In time for the committee to consider alternatives
- **At AGM**: As part of insurance reporting to owners
- **On request**: Whenever an owner asks

## How to Request Disclosure

### From Your Broker

Send a formal request:

> Dear [Broker],
>
> Under the 2025 NSW strata reforms, we request full disclosure of:
>
> 1. All commissions you receive on our strata insurance policy
> 2. Any volume bonuses or other insurer payments
> 3. Any fees charged to us directly
> 4. Any relationships with insurers that may affect recommendations
>
> Please provide this information before our next renewal on [date].
>
> Regards,
> [Secretary/Committee]

### From Your Strata Manager

If you have a strata manager:

> Dear [Manager],
>
> Under the 2025 NSW strata reforms, please confirm:
>
> 1. Whether you receive any payment or benefit related to our insurance
> 2. Whether the broker is a related party to your company
> 3. Whether you obtained independent quotes for comparison
>
> Please provide this disclosure in writing before our next renewal.
>
> Regards,
> [Committee]

## Understanding Commission Structures

### How Commissions Work

When you pay your strata insurance premium:

```
Premium you pay: $10,000
├── Goes to insurer: $7,000-8,000 (for claims, admin)
├── Broker commission: $1,500-2,500 (typically 15-25%)
└── Taxes and charges: $500-1,000 (stamp duty, levies)
```

### Commission vs Fee-Based Models

**Commission-based:**
- Broker receives % of premium from insurer
- No separate fee to you
- Higher premiums = higher broker income

**Fee-based:**
- Broker charges flat fee to you
- Returns or reduces commission
- More aligned with your interests

The reforms don't mandate one model over another—but you're now entitled to know which applies.

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Potential Conflicts of Interest

Be alert if:

- **Same company**: Your strata manager owns or is related to the insurance broker
- **No quotes**: Only one insurer quoted without explanation
- **Premium increases**: Significant increases without corresponding claims
- **Resistance to disclosure**: Reluctance to provide commission details

### Questions to Ask

1. "How much commission do you receive on our policy?"
2. "Do you receive any payments from our strata manager?"
3. "Did you obtain quotes from multiple insurers?"
4. "Is there any ownership relationship between your company and our strata manager?"
5. "What would be the premium under a fee-based arrangement?"

## What If Disclosure Isn't Provided?

### Escalation Steps

1. **Formal written request**: Put your request in writing with deadline
2. **Committee resolution**: Pass a motion requiring disclosure before renewal
3. **Fair Trading complaint**: Report non-compliance to NSW Fair Trading
4. **Change providers**: Consider using a broker who provides full transparency

### Consequences for Non-Compliance

Brokers and managers who fail to disclose may face:

- Regulatory action by Fair Trading
- Licence review
- Liability for losses caused by undisclosed conflicts
- Damage to professional reputation

## Choosing a Transparent Insurance Approach

### Option 1: Fee-Based Broker

Some brokers now offer fee-for-service models:

**Pros:**
- Full transparency on costs
- No incentive to recommend higher premiums
- Clearer value proposition

**Cons:**
- Upfront fee to pay
- May be more expensive for small schemes

### Option 2: Commission-Based with Full Disclosure

Continue with commission model but require:

- Annual disclosure of all commissions
- Comparison of at least 3 insurers
- Written confirmation of best recommendation

### Option 3: Direct to Insurer

For simple schemes, consider:

- Obtaining quotes directly from major insurers
- Using online comparison tools
- Engaging a broker only if needed

### Option 4: Insurance Committee

Establish a sub-committee to:

- Manage the annual insurance review
- Obtain and compare quotes
- Document the decision-making process
- Report to the full committee and AGM

## Documenting Your Insurance Process

Keep records showing:

### Before Renewal

- Quotes obtained (at least 3 if available)
- Commission disclosure from broker
- Comparison analysis
- Committee discussion and decision

### At Renewal

- Resolution to accept insurance
- Copy of certificate of currency
- Disclosure statements received
- Any conflicts declared

### For the AGM

- Summary of insurance for the year
- Broker commission disclosed
- Claims made (if any)
- Renewal approach for next year

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are high commissions illegal?

No. The reform doesn't cap commissions—it requires disclosure. You can then decide whether the commission represents fair value.

### What if our broker refuses to disclose?

This may be a breach of their obligations. Document the refusal and consider reporting to Fair Trading and finding a new broker.

### Do these rules apply to small schemes?

Yes. The disclosure requirements apply to all NSW strata schemes regardless of size.

### Can we negotiate broker commission?

Yes. With disclosure, you're in a better position to negotiate. Some brokers will rebate commission for long-term clients.

### What about insurance through body corporate services?

If your building has centralised insurance through a body corporate manager, the same disclosure rules apply. Request the information through your building manager.
