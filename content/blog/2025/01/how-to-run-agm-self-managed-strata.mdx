Running your first Annual General Meeting (AGM) as a self-managed strata scheme can feel daunting. This guide breaks down the entire process into manageable steps, ensuring your AGM is compliant and effective.

## Understanding AGM Requirements

Under the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW), every owners corporation must hold an AGM:

- Within the first 2 months after the initial period ends (for new schemes)
- Within 3 months of the end of each financial year (for established schemes)

<Warning>
Missing your AGM deadline is a compliance breach that must be reported to NSW Fair Trading via the Strata Hub.
</Warning>

## Timeline for Your AGM

Plan your AGM with this timeline:

| Weeks Before | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| 12 weeks | Set tentative date, book venue if needed |
| 8 weeks | Prepare draft budget and reports |
| 4 weeks | Finalize agenda and documents |
| 2-3 weeks | Send formal notice to all owners |
| 1 week | Collect proxy forms and prepare materials |
| AGM Day | Conduct meeting |
| 2 weeks after | Distribute minutes to owners |

## Step 1: Planning the Meeting

### Choosing a Date and Time

Consider:

- Most owners' availability (evenings or weekends often work best)
- Venue booking requirements
- Compliance deadline (within 3 months of financial year end)

### Venue Options

- Common property meeting room
- Community hall
- Online via video conference (permitted under NSW law)
- Hybrid (in-person and online)

<Tip>
Online and hybrid meetings can significantly improve attendance, especially for schemes with absentee owners.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Preparing the Agenda

Your AGM agenda must include mandatory items:

### Mandatory Agenda Items

1. **Confirmation of previous minutes** - Review and approve last AGM minutes
2. **Election of strata committee** - Elect committee members
3. **Financial reports** - Present income, expenditure, and fund balances
4. **Insurance review** - Confirm building insurance coverage
5. **Levy setting** - Approve administrative and capital works levies
6. **10-year capital works plan** - Review and update if needed

### Optional Agenda Items

- Appointment of auditor or reviewer
- Special resolutions (bylaw changes)
- General business raised by owners
- Reports from committee roles

## Step 3: Preparing Financial Reports

Your financial presentation should include:

### Income and Expenditure Statement

Show for the past financial year:

- Total levies received
- Interest earned
- Other income
- Itemized expenses
- Net surplus or deficit

### Fund Balance Statements

| Fund | Opening Balance | Income | Expenditure | Closing Balance |
|------|----------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Administrative | $X | $X | $X | $X |
| Capital Works | $X | $X | $X | $X |

### Budget for Coming Year

Present proposed:

- Administrative fund budget with line items
- Capital works fund contributions
- Calculated levy amounts per lot

<Info>
Section 93 of the Act requires these financial statements to be prepared in the prescribed form.
</Info>

## Step 4: Sending the Notice

### Notice Requirements

The AGM notice must:

- Be sent at least 14 days before the meeting (7 days for adjournments)
- Include the agenda
- Include all documents to be considered
- Include a proxy form
- Be delivered to all owners (mail, email if consented)

### What to Include

1. Notice of meeting with date, time, venue
2. Full agenda
3. Previous AGM minutes
4. Financial statements and reports
5. Proposed budget
6. Proposed levy amounts
7. Motions with full wording
8. Proxy form
9. Committee nomination forms

<Warning>
Failing to give proper notice can invalidate the meeting and any resolutions passed.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Proxy Forms

### Understanding Proxies

Owners who cannot attend can appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf. The proxy form must:

- Be in the prescribed form
- Be signed by the owner
- Specify the proxy holder
- Be received before the meeting

### Proxy Limits

One person can hold a maximum of:

- **Small schemes (under 20 lots)**: 1 proxy
- **Large schemes (20+ lots)**: 5% of lots (minimum 1)

## Step 6: Conducting the Meeting

### Before the Meeting

- Set up signing register
- Collect proxy forms
- Prepare ballot papers if needed
- Have copies of documents available

### During the Meeting

1. **Call to order** - Chairperson opens the meeting
2. **Confirm quorum** - 25% of total entitlements (in person or by proxy)
3. **Approve minutes** - Previous AGM minutes
4. **Reports** - Chair, Treasurer, Secretary reports
5. **Financial motions** - Budget approval, levy setting
6. **Elections** - Committee positions
7. **Other business** - Agenda items and general business
8. **Close** - Set date for next AGM

<Tip>
The chair should keep the meeting focused and ensure all owners have a chance to speak while maintaining order.
</Tip>

### Voting

Most resolutions require an **ordinary resolution** (majority vote). Special resolutions require 75% approval.

| Resolution Type | Approval Needed | Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ordinary | Simple majority | Budget, levies, committee election |
| Special | 75% | Bylaw changes, common property works |
| Unanimous | 100% | Structural changes, lot boundary changes |

## Step 7: After the Meeting

### Minutes

Minutes must be:

- Prepared within 14 days
- Distributed to all owners within 14 days
- Kept in the strata records for 7 years

### Minutes Should Include

- Date, time, and venue
- Attendance list (present and by proxy)
- All motions and their outcomes
- Vote counts for each motion
- Actions assigned

### Strata Hub Update

After the AGM, update the Strata Hub with:

- New committee members
- AGM date held
- Key resolutions

## Common AGM Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Insufficient Notice** - Always send notice at least 14 days before
2. **No Quorum** - If no quorum, you must adjourn and reconvene
3. **Invalid Proxies** - Check proxies are properly completed
4. **Missing Motions** - General business cannot include substantive motions
5. **Poor Record Keeping** - Minutes must be complete and accurate

<Danger>
Invalid AGMs can lead to legal challenges, compliance issues, and scheme governance problems.
</Danger>
