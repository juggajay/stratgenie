# Strata Levy Payment Plans NSW: New Mandatory Rules for 2025

From **1 October 2025**, NSW strata schemes have new obligations when lot owners request payment plans for overdue levies. The 2025 reforms require owners corporations to give genuine consideration to these requests and establish fair processes for managing financial hardship.

## What's Changed?

Previously, owners corporations could simply demand full payment and proceed directly to debt recovery. The 2025 reforms introduce a more balanced approach:

### New Owner Rights

- **Right to request**: Owners can formally request a payment plan
- **Right to consideration**: Schemes must genuinely consider requests
- **Right to reasons**: If refused, owners should receive explanation
- **Right to appeal**: Decisions can be challenged at NCAT

### New Scheme Obligations

- **Must have a process**: Establish a clear procedure for handling requests
- **Must respond promptly**: Acknowledge requests within reasonable timeframes
- **Must document decisions**: Keep records of considerations and outcomes
- **Must act fairly**: Demonstrate genuine consideration, not automatic refusal

## Who Can Request a Payment Plan?

Any lot owner who is experiencing financial hardship may request a payment plan. This includes:

- Owners facing temporary income reduction
- Owners with unexpected expenses
- Owners managing health-related financial impacts
- Owners affected by economic conditions

The owner doesn't need to prove destitution—genuine financial difficulty is sufficient grounds for a request.

## How to Handle Payment Plan Requests

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Request

When you receive a payment plan request:

1. Acknowledge receipt within 7 days
2. Advise the owner when their request will be considered
3. Request any additional information needed (income details, proposed plan)

**Sample acknowledgment:**

> Dear [Owner],
>
> We acknowledge your request for a payment plan dated [date]. Your request will be considered at the committee meeting on [date], or earlier if possible.
>
> Please provide a proposed payment schedule and any information about your circumstances that you wish the committee to consider.

### Step 2: Assess the Request

When considering the request, evaluate:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Amount owed** | Total arrears and current levies |
| **Payment history** | Previous compliance record |
| **Proposed plan** | Is the timeframe reasonable? |
| **Scheme's needs** | Cash flow requirements |
| **Owner's circumstances** | Severity of hardship |

### Step 3: Make a Decision

The committee should:

1. Discuss the request at a properly convened meeting
2. Consider all relevant factors
3. Make a decision by resolution
4. Document the reasoning

### Step 4: Communicate the Outcome

**If approved:**

- Confirm the payment plan in writing
- Specify amounts and due dates
- Note any conditions (e.g., automatic termination if payments missed)
- Thank the owner for communicating

**If refused:**

- Explain the reasons for refusal
- Suggest alternatives if available
- Advise of their right to apply to NCAT
- Maintain a respectful tone

## Creating a Payment Plan Policy

Every scheme should have a documented payment plan policy. This helps ensure consistent, fair treatment and provides a framework for decisions.

### Sample Policy Elements

```
PAYMENT PLAN POLICY - [Scheme Name]

1. PURPOSE
   To establish fair procedures for considering payment plan requests
   from lot owners experiencing financial hardship.

2. ELIGIBILITY
   Any owner may request a payment plan. Requests will be considered
   on their individual merits.

3. PROCESS
   a) Requests must be in writing to the Secretary
   b) Committee will consider within 14 days
   c) Owner will be notified of outcome within 7 days of decision

4. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
   - Amount outstanding
   - Owner's payment history
   - Reasonableness of proposed plan
   - Scheme's financial position
   - Owner's demonstrated hardship

5. STANDARD TERMS
   - Maximum plan duration: 12 months
   - Minimum payment: $X per week/month
   - Interest: [waived / charged at X%]
   - Missed payment: Plan may be cancelled

6. DOCUMENTATION
   All requests and decisions will be documented and retained.

7. REVIEW
   This policy will be reviewed annually at the AGM.
```

## What's a "Reasonable" Payment Plan?

There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but consider:

### Timeframe

- **3-6 months**: Appropriate for smaller arrears
- **6-12 months**: Reasonable for larger amounts
- **Beyond 12 months**: May be excessive unless circumstances warrant

### Payment Amount

- Should make meaningful progress on the debt
- Should be affordable for the owner
- Should consider ongoing levies (not just arrears)

### Example Payment Plans

**Scenario 1: $2,000 arrears**
- Owner proposes $200/month for 10 months
- Plus ongoing quarterly levies as they fall due
- **Assessment**: Reasonable—clears debt within a year

**Scenario 2: $8,000 arrears**
- Owner proposes $100/month for 80 months
- **Assessment**: May be too long—negotiate higher payments or shorter term

**Scenario 3: Owner in severe hardship**
- Owner proposes $50/month temporarily
- Review in 6 months
- **Assessment**: May be appropriate with regular reviews

## Can You Charge Interest?

The reforms don't prevent charging interest on overdue levies, but consider:

- Interest may increase the owner's burden
- Waiving interest can encourage engagement
- Your by-laws may specify interest rates
- NCAT may view excessive interest unfavorably

Many schemes waive interest for owners who proactively seek payment plans.

## What If the Owner Doesn't Comply?

If an approved payment plan fails:

1. **First missed payment**: Contact owner, remind of agreement
2. **Second missed payment**: Written notice that plan may be cancelled
3. **Continued non-payment**: Cancel plan, resume normal recovery

Document all communications and give reasonable opportunity to rectify.

## Proceeding to Debt Recovery

You can still recover debts, but the new process means:

1. **Before recovery action**: Ensure Financial Hardship Statement was provided
2. **Consider requests**: If owner requests a plan, consider it genuinely
3. **Document everything**: Show you followed proper process
4. **NCAT applications**: Tribunal will consider whether you acted fairly

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we refuse all payment plan requests?

No. You must give genuine consideration to each request. Blanket refusals could be challenged at NCAT.

### What if we can't afford to wait for payment?

Your scheme's financial position is a legitimate consideration. If immediate cash flow is critical, explain this when assessing the request.

### Do we need owner approval for payment plans?

No. The committee can approve payment plans without a general meeting resolution, as it's part of normal levy management.

### What about owners who repeatedly request plans?

Consider the pattern of behavior. Repeated requests might indicate:
- Ongoing hardship (may need longer-term solution)
- Deliberate avoidance (may warrant stricter approach)

Document your assessment each time.

## Next Steps
