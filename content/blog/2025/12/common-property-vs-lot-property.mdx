One of the most common sources of confusion in strata living is understanding what belongs to you as a lot owner versus what belongs to everyone as common property. This distinction affects your maintenance responsibilities, renovation rights, and even your insurance coverage.

## What is Lot Property?

Your lot, sometimes called a unit or apartment, is the private property you own outright. In NSW strata schemes, lot property typically includes:

- **Internal walls and surfaces** - The paint, wallpaper, and internal wall linings
- **Floor coverings** - Carpet, tiles, and floating floors (but usually not the structural floor)
- **Internal fixtures** - Kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, built-in wardrobes
- **Doors and windows** - Interior doors and sometimes external windows (check your by-laws)
- **Appliances** - Your personal appliances and those installed by you
- **Utilities within your lot** - Pipes, wires, and ducts servicing only your lot

<Tip>
Your strata plan registered with NSW Land Registry Services precisely defines the boundaries of your lot. When in doubt, check your strata plan or consult with your strata committee.
</Tip>

## What is Common Property?

Common property belongs to all lot owners collectively through the owners corporation. It typically includes:

### Structural Elements
- External walls (the structural component)
- Roof and roof space
- Building foundations
- Common staircases and hallways
- Lift shafts and lifts
- Structural floors and ceilings

### Shared Facilities
- Swimming pools and gyms
- Gardens and landscaping
- Car park areas (unless allocated as part of a lot)
- Visitor parking
- Building entrance and foyer
- Garbage rooms

### Building Services
- Main water pipes and drainage
- Electrical wiring in common areas
- Fire safety systems
- Intercom and security systems
- Air conditioning serving common areas

<Warning>
Boundary walls between lots are typically common property. You cannot modify them without owners corporation approval, even if they're inside your unit.
</Warning>

## The Critical Boundary: Where Does Your Lot End?

Understanding where your lot ends and common property begins is crucial for:

### 1. Maintenance Responsibilities

| Area | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Inside your lot walls | Lot owner |
| Structural walls | Owners corporation |
| Your balcony tiles | Usually lot owner |
| Balcony waterproofing | Usually owners corporation |
| Windows and frames | Check your by-laws |
| Plumbing in your walls | Shared responsibility |

### 2. Renovation Approvals

Before any renovation work, determine:
- Is it entirely within your lot? Minor works may only need notification
- Does it affect common property? You'll need a special by-law or common property rights by-law
- Does it affect structural elements? Full owners corporation approval required

### 3. Insurance Coverage

- **Building insurance** (paid through levies) covers common property
- **Contents insurance** (your responsibility) covers your belongings
- **Lot owner improvements** may need separate coverage

## Special Cases: Common Areas with Private Use

Some areas blur the line between common and lot property:

### Balconies and Courtyards

Typically common property with exclusive use rights granted to specific lots. This means:
- The structure is common property (owners corporation maintains)
- You have exclusive use (only you can access it)
- Maintenance of surfaces may be your responsibility
- Structural repairs remain with the owners corporation

### Car Spaces

Can be structured as:
- Part of your lot (shown on strata plan)
- Common property with exclusive use
- Common property open to all owners

### Storage Cages

Similar to car spaces, check whether they're:
- Lot property (part of your title)
- Common property with exclusive use rights

<Info>
Exclusive use by-laws can vary significantly between schemes. Always check your specific scheme's by-laws to understand your rights and responsibilities.

## How to Check What's Common Property

### Step 1: Review Your Strata Plan

Your strata plan shows:
- The exact boundaries of each lot
- Areas marked as common property
- Any easements or rights of way

### Step 2: Check the By-Laws

Your scheme's by-laws may:
- Grant exclusive use of common property to specific lots
- Allocate maintenance responsibilities
- Define what lot owners can and cannot do

### Step 3: Consult the Strata Roll

The strata roll lists:
- All lots and their owners
- Unit entitlements
- Any special conditions or restrictions

## Common Disputes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Water Damage

Water damage often involves both lot and common property. Best practice:
- Report any leaks immediately
- Document everything with photos
- Don't attempt repairs until responsibility is determined

### 2. Renovation Works

Before starting any work:
- Get written approval from the strata committee
- Ensure proper by-laws are in place for common property works
- Use licensed, insured contractors

### 3. Maintenance Disagreements

When disputes arise:
- Check the strata plan and by-laws first
- Raise issues at committee meetings
- Seek mediation through NSW Fair Trading if needed

<Danger>
Never assume maintenance responsibility based on location alone. A pipe inside your wall might service multiple lots, making it common property. Always verify before undertaking repairs.
</Danger>

## NSW Legislation Reference

The key legislation governing common property in NSW:

- **Strata Schemes Management Act 2015** - Defines owners corporation responsibilities
- **Strata Schemes Development Act 2015** - Covers strata plan registration
- **Strata Schemes Management Regulation 2016** - Details operational requirements

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who pays for a leaking pipe inside my wall?

It depends on whether the pipe services only your lot (your responsibility) or multiple lots (common property). If unsure, get a plumber to trace the pipe before assuming responsibility.

### Can I enclose my balcony?

Balconies are usually common property, so enclosing one requires owners corporation approval and often a special by-law. The structural changes involved make this a significant modification.

### Are my window frames lot or common property?

This varies by scheme. Check your strata plan and by-laws. Many schemes make window frames common property while the glass is lot owner responsibility.

### Who maintains the garden bed outside my ground floor unit?

Unless you have exclusive use rights documented in a by-law, garden beds are common property maintained by the owners corporation.

### Can I install an air conditioner on common property?

You'll need owners corporation approval and usually a common property rights by-law. The by-law should cover installation, maintenance, and what happens when you sell.
