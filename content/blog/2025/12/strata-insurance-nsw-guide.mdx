# Complete Guide to Strata Insurance in NSW

Strata insurance is mandatory in NSW and often represents one of the largest expenses in your scheme's budget. Understanding what you need, what you're covered for, and how to get value is essential for every committee.

## Insurance Requirements in NSW

### Mandatory Insurance

Under the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015, every strata scheme must maintain:

| Type | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Building damage** | Full replacement value |
| **Workers compensation** | If employing any workers |
| **Public liability** | Recommended minimum $20 million |

<Danger>
Failing to maintain adequate building insurance is a breach of the Act and can result in penalties for the owners corporation.
</Danger>

### What "Full Replacement Value" Means

Full replacement value includes:

- Complete rebuilding cost if totally destroyed
- Demolition and debris removal
- Professional fees (architects, engineers)
- Council and regulatory costs
- Temporary accommodation provisions
- Compliance with current building codes

<Warning>
Under-insurance is a common problem. If you're insured for $10 million but replacement costs $15 million, you'll only receive two-thirds of any claim (average clause).
</Warning>

## Types of Strata Insurance

### Building Insurance (Owners Corporation)

The owners corporation policy covers:

**Structure:**
- External and internal walls
- Roof and guttering
- Floors and ceilings
- Fixtures and fittings
- Common area carpets and furnishings

**Building Services:**
- Lifts and escalators
- Fire safety systems
- Air conditioning (common)
- Electrical systems
- Plumbing systems

**External Areas:**
- Driveways and paths
- Fencing and gates
- Swimming pools
- Gardens and landscaping
- Car parking structures

### Lot Owner Fixtures

Most strata policies also cover "lot owner improvements" to a certain limit, including:

- Kitchen and bathroom renovations
- Built-in wardrobes
- Internal painting and flooring
- Fixed appliances

<Tip>
Check your policy's lot owner improvements limit. If you've done significant renovations, you may need additional coverage.
</Tip>

### Contents Insurance (Individual Owners)

The building policy does NOT cover:

- Furniture and personal belongings
- Portable appliances
- Electronics and valuables
- Clothing and personal items
- Alternative accommodation (usually)

Every lot owner and tenant should arrange their own contents insurance.

### Public Liability Insurance

Covers claims arising from:

- Injuries on common property
- Property damage caused by the scheme
- Legal defence costs

**Recommended minimum:** $20 million (some schemes carry $50 million)

### Office Bearers Liability

Protects committee members against claims for:

- Wrongful acts in their capacity as office bearers
- Defence costs for allegations
- Settlements or judgments

### Workers Compensation

Required if your scheme:

- Directly employs anyone (caretaker, cleaner)
- Even casually or part-time
- Including contractors in some circumstances

## Understanding Your Policy

### Key Policy Sections

| Section | What It Covers |
|---------|----------------|
| **Section 1** | Building damage (fire, storm, etc.) |
| **Section 2** | Common contents |
| **Section 3** | Lot owner fixtures |
| **Section 4** | Public liability |
| **Section 5** | Office bearers |
| **Section 6** | Workers compensation |
| **Section 7** | Optional covers |

### Common Exclusions

Be aware that most policies exclude:

- **Wear and tear** - Normal aging and deterioration
- **Maintenance failures** - Damage from lack of upkeep
- **Pre-existing defects** - Known problems before policy
- **Gradual damage** - Slow water penetration, rising damp
- **Earthquakes** - May require additional cover
- **Floods** - Often excluded or requires add-on
- **Asbestos** - Removal not typically covered

<Info>
Always read the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) to understand what's excluded from your policy.
</Info>

### Optional Add-Ons

Consider these additional covers:

| Add-On | When Needed |
|--------|-------------|
| **Flood cover** | Near waterways or flood zones |
| **Earthquake** | All NSW schemes should consider |
| **Machinery breakdown** | Schemes with lifts, HVAC |
| **Fidelity guarantee** | Protects against theft by officials |
| **Legal expenses** | Disputes and tribunal matters |
| **Lot owner extensions** | Higher renovation cover |

## Getting the Right Valuation

### Why Valuations Matter

An accurate valuation ensures:

- You're fully covered in a total loss
- You don't pay excessive premiums
- Claims are paid in full
- No average clause penalties

### Valuation Frequency

| Scheme Size | Recommended Frequency |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Small (2-10 lots)** | Every 3-5 years |
| **Medium (11-50 lots)** | Every 3 years |
| **Large (50+ lots)** | Every 2-3 years |
| **Complex buildings** | Annually |

### What a Valuation Includes

A professional valuation assesses:

- Building replacement cost (not market value)
- Demolition and debris removal
- Professional fees (10-15%)
- Council contributions and fees
- Code compliance upgrades
- Temporary accommodation allowance

### Declared vs Assessed Values

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Declared value** | Amount you nominate (you take the risk) |
| **Assessed value** | Based on professional valuation |

<Warning>
If you declare a value without a valuation and it's too low, you may be under-insured and face the average clause.
</Warning>

## Managing Insurance Costs

### Factors Affecting Premiums

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Building age** | Older = higher risk |
| **Construction type** | Timber/heritage = higher |
| **Location** | Flood/bushfire zones = higher |
| **Claims history** | Recent claims = higher |
| **Sum insured** | Higher value = higher premium |
| **Excess level** | Higher excess = lower premium |
| **Security features** | Better security = lower |

### Ways to Reduce Premiums

1. **Increase excess** - Higher out-of-pocket reduces premium
2. **Bundle covers** - All covers with one insurer
3. **Improve security** - CCTV, access control, lighting
4. **Maintain building** - Reduce risk of claims
5. **Shop around** - Compare quotes from multiple insurers
6. **Review annually** - Don't auto-renew blindly

### Premium Benchmarks

Typical premium ranges (excluding excess and levies):

| Building Type | $/Million Insured |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Low-rise residential** | $1,000-2,500 |
| **High-rise residential** | $2,500-4,000 |
| **Mixed-use** | $3,000-5,000 |
| **Heritage/complex** | $4,000-8,000 |

These are indicative only—actual premiums vary significantly by scheme.

## The Claims Process

### When to Make a Claim

Make a claim for:

- Sudden and accidental damage
- Storm damage
- Fire and smoke damage
- Water damage (from sudden events)
- Theft or vandalism
- Third-party injuries

### Don't Claim For

- Minor damage below excess
- Maintenance issues
- Gradual deterioration
- Pre-existing problems

<Tip>
Small claims can increase future premiums. Consider paying for minor repairs directly if they're close to your excess amount.
</Tip>

### Steps to Make a Claim

1. **Document** the damage (photos, videos)
2. **Prevent** further damage (temporary repairs)
3. **Notify** insurer promptly
4. **Complete** claim form accurately
5. **Obtain** quotes as required
6. **Cooperate** with assessor
7. **Keep** all receipts and records

### Who Lodges the Claim?

| Damage Location | Who Claims |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Common property** | Owners corporation |
| **Lot interior** | Usually owners corporation |
| **Lot contents** | Lot owner (their policy) |
| **Liability** | Owners corporation |

### Excess (Deductible)

| Claim Type | Typical Excess |
|------------|----------------|
| **Building damage** | $500-2,500 |
| **Water damage** | $1,000-5,000 |
| **Machinery** | $1,000-2,500 |
| **Public liability** | $500-1,000 |

<Info>
Your by-laws may allocate excess responsibility to the lot owner whose lot caused or was affected by the damage.
</Info>

## Insurance Disclosure Requirements

### 2025 Reform Changes

From 1 October 2025, schemes must:

- Include insurance commission disclosure in AGM reports
- Provide commission details on request
- Disclose any strata manager/broker relationships

See our [Insurance Commission Disclosure Guide](/blog/disclosure-of-insurance-commissions-strata) for more details.

### AGM Reporting

Your AGM papers should include:

- Current insurer and policy number
- Sum insured and valuation date
- Premium paid
- Broker commission disclosed
- Claims made during the year
- Recommendation for renewal

## Choosing a Broker

### Benefits of Using a Broker

- Access to multiple insurers
- Expert advice on coverage
- Claims assistance
- Annual review service
- Competitive quoting

### What to Look For

| Criteria | Why Important |
|----------|---------------|
| **Strata specialist** | Understands specific needs |
| **Multiple insurer access** | Better quotes |
| **Claims support** | Help when you need it |
| **Transparent fees** | No hidden costs |
| **References** | Proven track record |

### Fee-Based vs Commission

| Model | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Commission** | Broker receives % from insurer |
| **Fee-based** | Flat fee to you, reduced/no commission |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of both |

## Common Insurance Issues

### Under-Insurance

**Problem:** Sum insured is less than replacement cost
**Consequence:** Average clause reduces claim payments
**Solution:** Regular professional valuations

### Over-Insurance

**Problem:** Paying for more cover than needed
**Consequence:** Higher premiums, same claim outcome
**Solution:** Accurate valuation, don't inflate values

### Claim Disputes

**Problem:** Insurer denies or disputes claim
**Solution:**
1. Review policy wording carefully
2. Provide additional documentation
3. Escalate to insurer's internal complaints
4. Contact AFCA (Australian Financial Complaints Authority)

### Renewal Confusion

**Problem:** Policy lapses or wrong cover
**Solution:**
- Set calendar reminders 60 days before renewal
- Review cover annually before renewing
- Never let policy lapse even for a day

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who pays for insurance in a strata scheme?

All lot owners contribute through their levies. The insurance cost is typically the largest item in the administrative fund budget.

### Can individual owners opt out of building insurance?

No. Building insurance is mandatory and covers all lots. The owners corporation must maintain it on behalf of all owners.

### What if our premium increases significantly?

Obtain quotes from multiple insurers, consider increasing excess, review optional covers, and ensure your valuation is accurate. If your building has had claims, premiums may take time to reduce.

### Do we need separate insurance for common property furniture?

Usually this is covered under "common contents" in your strata policy. Check the limit is adequate for items like lobby furniture, gym equipment, and pool furniture.

### What happens if a lot owner causes damage to common property?

The owners corporation claims on its policy. The excess may be recovered from the lot owner, depending on your by-laws and circumstances.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** your current policy and PDS
2. **Check** when your last valuation was done
3. **Compare** quotes before next renewal
4. **Request** commission disclosure from your broker
5. **Update** your AGM reporting template
