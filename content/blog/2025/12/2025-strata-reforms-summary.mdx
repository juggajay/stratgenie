## Frequently Asked Questions

### When do the reforms apply?

Most changes took effect 1 October 2025. However, they apply to actions taken after that date—you don't need to retrospectively update old levy notices, for example.

### Do small schemes need to comply?

Yes. The reforms apply to all NSW strata schemes regardless of size. Some requirements may be simpler for smaller schemes, but they still apply.

### What if we didn't know about the reforms?

Ignorance isn't a defence, but Fair Trading is likely to focus education and enforcement on ensuring future compliance rather than punishing past oversights. Start complying now.

### Are there penalties for non-compliance?

The legislation includes penalty provisions, and non-compliance may affect your ability to pursue debt recovery or defend against NCAT applications. Building good practice protects your scheme.

### Where can we get help implementing the changes?

NSW Fair Trading provides free resources and training. StrataGenie offers tools and guides. For complex situations, consider engaging a strata lawyer or consultant.
