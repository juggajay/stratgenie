# How to Handle Levy Arrears in NSW Strata

Unpaid levies affect every owner in your scheme. When one owner doesn't pay, others must cover the shortfall or essential services suffer. This guide explains how to manage arrears effectively while complying with NSW law.

## The Impact of Levy Arrears

### Why Arrears Are Serious

Unpaid levies cause:

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash flow problems** | Can't pay bills on time |
| **Higher levies** | Others must cover shortfall |
| **Delayed maintenance** | Work postponed or cancelled |
| **Interest costs** | Overdraft or loan interest |
| **Committee stress** | Time spent chasing payments |

<Warning>
Prolonged arrears can prevent the scheme from maintaining insurance, meeting statutory obligations, or carrying out essential repairs.
</Warning>

### How Common Are Arrears?

Most schemes experience some level of arrears:

| Arrears Level | Typical Schemes |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **< 5%** | Well-managed schemes |
| **5-10%** | Common, manageable |
| **10-20%** | Needs active management |
| **> 20%** | Serious financial risk |

## Prevention Strategies

### Making Payment Easy

Remove barriers to payment:

- **Multiple payment options** - BPAY, direct debit, credit card
- **Clear levy notices** - Due dates and amounts obvious
- **Automated reminders** - Email or SMS before due date
- **Direct debit incentives** - Encourage auto-payments
- **Online portal** - View balance and pay anytime

### Communication

Keep owners informed:

- **Regular statements** - Quarterly balance updates
- **Budget transparency** - Explain what levies fund
- **Early contact** - Reach out at first sign of delay
- **Non-judgmental approach** - Circumstances vary

### By-Law Provisions

Consider by-laws that:

- Set clear payment due dates
- Specify interest rates for late payment
- Outline debt recovery procedures
- Allocate cost recovery rights

## The 2025 Reform Requirements

### Financial Hardship Statement

From 1 October 2025, every levy notice must include a Financial Hardship Information Statement informing owners they can:

- Request a payment plan
- Seek assistance before arrears escalate
- Understand their options

See our [Financial Hardship Statement Guide](/blog/financial-hardship-information-statement-strata) for the full requirements.

### Payment Plan Obligations

When an owner requests a payment plan, you must:

1. **Genuinely consider** the request
2. **Respond in writing** within reasonable timeframe
3. **Document your decision** and reasoning
4. **Provide reasons** if refusing

<Info>
Blanket refusals of payment plan requests may be challenged at NCAT. Each request must be considered on its merits.
</Info>

## Debt Recovery Process

### Step 1: Reminder (1-30 Days Overdue)

Initial contact:

- Send friendly reminder after due date
- Confirm correct contact details
- Offer to discuss payment options
- Include Financial Hardship Statement

**Sample reminder:**

> Dear [Owner],
>
> Our records show your levy of $[amount] due on [date] has not been received. If you've already paid, please disregard this notice.
>
> If you're experiencing difficulty paying, please contact us to discuss options. The enclosed Financial Hardship Information Statement explains how you can request a payment plan.
>
> [Secretary]

### Step 2: Formal Demand (30-60 Days Overdue)

If no response to reminder:

- Send formal letter by registered post
- Clearly state amount owing plus interest
- Set deadline for payment or response
- Warn of further action if not addressed

**Key elements:**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Amount owing** | Principal + interest to date |
| **Due date** | Specific date for response |
| **Interest rate** | As per by-laws or 10% default |
| **Next steps** | What happens if not paid |

### Step 3: Committee Resolution (60-90 Days)

Before proceeding to recovery action:

- Discuss at committee meeting
- Consider any hardship circumstances
- Resolve to proceed with recovery
- Document the decision

### Step 4: Pre-Litigation Notice

Send a final demand:

- State this is final notice before legal action
- Give 14-21 days to respond
- Offer last opportunity for payment plan
- Explain costs will be added if proceeding

### Step 5: NCAT Application

If all else fails, apply to NCAT:

| Application Type | When to Use |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Levy recovery** | Straightforward debt |
| **Order for compliance** | If owner disputes |
| **Appointment of administrator** | Serious ongoing issues |

### Step 6: Enforcement

If NCAT order is obtained:

- Register with Local Court if amount > $750
- Apply for enforcement action
- Options include garnishee orders, writs
- Consider whether enforcement is worthwhile

## Legal Options Explained

### NCAT (NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal)

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost than court
- No lawyer required
- Relatively quick
- Designed for strata disputes

**Process:**
1. Lodge application with fee (~$56-112)
2. NCAT notifies the owner
3. Matter listed for hearing
4. Tribunal makes order
5. Owner must comply or face penalties

### Local Court

**When to use:**
- Amounts over $10,000
- Complex cases
- Need enforcement mechanisms

**Considerations:**
- Higher costs
- May need legal representation
- Longer process

### Interest and Costs

You can recover:

| Cost | Recoverability |
|------|----------------|
| **Interest** | Yes, at by-law rate or 10% simple |
| **NCAT filing fee** | Yes |
| **Legal costs** | Usually capped at $500-2,000 |
| **Admin costs** | Limited recovery |

<Warning>
Legal costs can quickly exceed the debt, especially for small amounts. Consider whether recovery makes commercial sense.
</Warning>

## Special Situations

### Deceased Estate

When an owner dies:

- Contact the executor (if known)
- Lodge claim with the estate
- Be patient but persistent
- Debt passes to estate, not heirs personally

### Owner in Administration

If an owner has a bankruptcy trustee or administrator:

- Lodge proof of debt with administrator
- Stop direct debt recovery
- You become an unsecured creditor
- May receive partial payment

### Company-Owned Lots

For company owners:

- Check if company is still registered
- Directors may have personal liability
- Consider ASIC searches for contact details
- Can wind up company for unpaid debts (rarely worthwhile)

### Investor Owners

Strategies for investor owners:

- Contact managing agent directly
- Remind of mortgage implications
- Suggest direct debit from rent
- Note that rental income often covers levies

## Best Practices

### Documentation

Keep records of:

- All levy notices sent
- Reminder letters and dates
- Phone conversations (notes)
- Emails and correspondence
- Payment plan agreements
- Committee decisions

### Consistency

Apply your process consistently:

- Same timeline for all owners
- Same letters and reminders
- Document any exceptions and reasons
- Fair treatment protects against challenges

### Proportionality

Match response to situation:

| Arrears Level | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **1 quarter** | Reminder, offer payment plan |
| **2 quarters** | Formal demand, contact attempt |
| **3+ quarters** | Committee review, consider NCAT |
| **Persistent** | Recovery action |

### Review Aged Debtors

At every committee meeting:

- Review aged debtor list
- Discuss progress on each case
- Decide next steps
- Monitor total arrears percentage

## Payment Plans

### When to Offer

Consider payment plans when:

- Owner communicates proactively
- Genuine hardship demonstrated
- First time in arrears
- Realistic plan proposed

### Terms to Include

| Term | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Total amount owing** | Clear debt amount |
| **Payment schedule** | Amounts and dates |
| **Interest** | Whether waived or charged |
| **Default clause** | What happens if missed |
| **Review date** | When to reassess |
| **Ongoing levies** | How current levies handled |

### Sample Payment Plan

```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we name owners in arrears at the AGM?

Generally not recommended. Discuss total arrears without identifying individuals unless necessary for specific resolutions. Privacy and defamation considerations apply.

### What if the owner disputes the amount?

Provide a detailed statement showing all levies, payments, and interest. If they still dispute, suggest they raise the matter at NCAT if you cannot resolve it.

### Can we refuse to give copies of records to an owner in arrears?

No. Owners have a right to records regardless of their levy status. You cannot withhold services or rights due to unpaid levies.

### Do arrears transfer when a lot is sold?

Yes. Arrears attach to the lot, not the person. New owners inherit the debt. Conveyancers should check this before settlement via a strata certificate.

### Can we charge credit card fees?

Yes, but you must disclose the fee and it must only recover actual costs. Some schemes absorb the cost to encourage payment.

### What's a reasonable interest rate?

Your by-laws may set a rate. If not, 10% simple interest per annum is the statutory default. Courts may reduce excessive rates.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** your current arrears position
2. **Update** levy notices with Financial Hardship Statement
3. **Create** or review your payment plan policy
4. **Establish** a consistent debt recovery process
5. **Monitor** arrears at every committee meeting
