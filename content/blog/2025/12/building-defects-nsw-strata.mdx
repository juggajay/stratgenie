# Building Defects in NSW Strata: Owner Rights and Remedies

Building defects are unfortunately common in NSW strata schemes, particularly in newer buildings. Understanding your rights, the warranty periods, and how to pursue remedies is essential for protecting your investment and your scheme.

## What Are Building Defects?

### Definition

A building defect is work that:

- Fails to meet the Building Code of Australia
- Doesn't comply with approved plans
- Doesn't meet the contractual standard
- Is incomplete or faulty

### Common Defect Types

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Waterproofing** | Leaking balconies, roofs, basements |
| **Structural** | Cracking, movement, inadequate supports |
| **Fire safety** | Non-compliant materials, missing systems |
| **Finishes** | Poor paintwork, uneven surfaces |
| **Services** | Faulty plumbing, electrical issues |
| **External** | Cladding problems, drainage issues |

<Warning>
Waterproofing defects are the most common issue in NSW strata buildings. Early detection and action is critical to prevent extensive damage.
</Warning>

## Statutory Warranty Periods

### NSW Warranty Coverage

Under the Home Building Act 1989, residential building work has statutory warranties:

| Defect Type | Warranty Period |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Major defects** | 6 years from completion |
| **Other defects** | 2 years from completion |

### What's a Major Defect?

A major defect is one that:

- Causes or is likely to cause inability to inhabit, or
- Causes destruction of the building, or
- Threatens collapse of the building, or
- Causes a major element to be unable to perform its intended function

**Examples of major defects:**
- Waterproofing failure causing water penetration
- Structural inadequacy
- Fire safety system failures
- Cladding defects (combustible cladding)

### When Does the Warranty Start?

The warranty period starts from:

| Situation | Start Date |
|-----------|------------|
| **New building** | Date of completion |
| **Staged completion** | Date each stage completed |
| **Individual lots** | Often staged |
| **Common property** | Usually whole building completion |

<Info>
"Completion" typically means when the occupation certificate is issued, not when you settled on your lot.
</Info>

## Identifying Defects

### Common Signs

Watch for:

| Sign | Potential Defect |
|------|------------------|
| **Water stains** | Waterproofing failure |
| **Cracks** | Structural movement |
| **Mould/mildew** | Water ingress |
| **Bubbling paint** | Moisture problems |
| **Doors/windows sticking** | Building movement |
| **Ponding water** | Drainage issues |
| **Odours** | Plumbing/ventilation problems |

### When to Investigate

Conduct formal inspections:

| Timing | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Before 2 years** | Catch minor defects before warranty expires |
| **Before 6 years** | Final opportunity for major defect claims |
| **After storm/event** | Check for damage or revealed defects |
| **When symptoms appear** | Don't wait for problems to worsen |

### Professional Inspections

Consider engaging:

| Professional | When Needed |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Building consultant** | General defect assessment |
| **Structural engineer** | Cracking, movement, structural concerns |
| **Waterproofing specialist** | Leaks, water damage |
| **Fire engineer** | Fire safety systems |
| **Facade specialist** | Cladding, external issues |

## Making a Defect Claim

### Who Can Claim?

| Claimant | What They Can Claim |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Owners corporation** | Common property defects |
| **Individual owners** | Defects within their lot |
| **Both together** | Often efficient for building-wide issues |

### Step 1: Document the Defects

Gather evidence:

- Photographs with dates
- Written descriptions
- Expert reports
- Correspondence history
- Timeline of when defects appeared
- Repair attempts and costs

### Step 2: Notify the Builder

Send formal written notice:

| Include | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Building details** | Address, strata plan number |
| **Defects identified** | Specific description of each |
| **Evidence** | Reference attached reports/photos |
| **Remedy sought** | What you want them to do |
| **Timeframe** | Reasonable deadline to respond |
| **Warranty reference** | Cite the statutory warranty |

**Sample notice opening:**

> Dear [Builder],
>
> We write on behalf of the Owners Corporation of SP [Number] regarding building defects at [Address].
>
> The following defects have been identified within the statutory warranty period:
>
> [List defects with descriptions]
>
> We request that you rectify these defects within [timeframe] in accordance with your obligations under the Home Building Act 1989.

### Step 3: Allow Opportunity to Rectify

| Action | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|
| **Response expected** | 14-28 days |
| **Inspection** | Allow builder to inspect |
| **Rectification** | Reasonable time based on scope |
| **Re-inspection** | Verify work completed properly |

### Step 4: Escalate if Necessary

If the builder doesn't respond or refuses:

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **NSW Fair Trading** | Complaint and potential intervention |
| **Mediation** | Attempt to resolve by agreement |
| **NCAT Building** | Formal determination |
| **Court** | Complex or high-value matters |

## Developer Bonds

### Strata Defects Bond Scheme

For residential strata buildings with 4+ storeys built after 2018:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Bond amount** | 2% of contract price |
| **Held by** | NSW Fair Trading or approved entity |
| **Duration** | 10 years from completion |
| **Purpose** | Security for defect claims |

### Claiming on the Bond

The owners corporation can claim if:

- Defect is identified within the bond period
- Builder has not rectified despite opportunity
- Claim is for common property or shared areas

<Tip>
The bond doesn't replace warranty claims but provides security if the builder won't or can't pay.
</Tip>

## Strata Building Bond and Inspections

### Mandatory Inspections

For buildings subject to the scheme:

| Inspection | Timing |
|------------|--------|
| **Interim report** | 15-18 months after completion |
| **Final report** | 18-24 months after completion |

### Inspection Requirements

- Must be conducted by a qualified building inspector
- Report must be provided to the builder
- Opportunity for builder to rectify before final
- Bond can be claimed if defects not fixed

## Dealing with Insolvent Builders

### When Builders Fail

Unfortunately, some builders become insolvent. Options:

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Home Building Compensation Fund** | Claim for insured residential work |
| **Strata defects bond** | If applicable |
| **Claim against directors** | In some circumstances |
| **Self-fund repairs** | May be only option |

### Home Building Compensation Fund

Coverage:

- Residential work over $20,000
- Builder died, disappeared, or insolvent
- Maximum claim limits apply
- Must be within warranty period

## Committee Responsibilities

### What the Committee Should Do

| Responsibility | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **Monitor** | Watch for signs of defects |
| **Document** | Record issues when identified |
| **Investigate** | Get professional advice |
| **Notify** | Contact builder within warranty |
| **Pursue** | Take appropriate action |
| **Report** | Keep owners informed |

### Decision Points

Key decisions for the committee:

| Decision | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| **Engage experts** | Cost vs. value of advice |
| **Pursue claim** | Strength of case, costs, time |
| **Accept settlement** | Is offer fair and adequate? |
| **Fund repairs** | If claim unsuccessful |
| **Engage lawyers** | Complex or high-value matters |

<Warning>
Defect claims are often complex and time-sensitive. Early professional advice is usually worthwhile.
</Warning>

## Special Situations

### Combustible Cladding

For buildings with combustible cladding:

- Register on the NSW Cladding Register if required
- Assessment by fire engineer
- Remediation may be required
- Special funding mechanisms may apply

### Staged Developments

For buildings completed in stages:

- Different warranty periods may apply to different parts
- Track completion dates carefully
- May have multiple builders or developers

### Successor Developers

If the original developer has sold:

- Warranties may transfer
- Original builder may still be liable
- May need to pursue both parties

## Funding Defect Rectification

### When You Must Pay

If warranty claims are unsuccessful or unavailable:

| Funding Source | When Appropriate |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Capital works fund** | If funds available |
| **Special levy** | For unbudgeted costs |
| **Strata loan** | Spread cost over time |
| **Insurance** | If covered (often not for defects) |

### Cost Recovery

If you pay first and pursue the builder:

- Keep detailed records of all costs
- Include professional fees, alternative accommodation
- Interest may be claimable
- Success not guaranteed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I withhold levies because of defects?

No. Levy obligations continue regardless of defect disputes. Withholding creates personal liability.

### What if defects appear after warranty expires?

You may still have claims under contract law or for misleading conduct, but statutory warranties won't apply. Act quickly and get legal advice.

### Should we sue individually or as an owners corporation?

Usually, owners corporation for common property, individual owners for lot defects. Sometimes a combined class action is more efficient. Get legal advice.

### How long do claims take?

Typically 1-3 years for complex matters through NCAT or court. Simple matters with cooperative builders can resolve in months.

### What if some owners don't want to pursue claims?

The owners corporation can resolve to pursue common property claims by majority vote. Individual owners decide their own lot claims.

### Are defect claims covered by insurance?

Rarely. Building insurance typically excludes defects. You may have insurance for consequential damage (e.g., water damage from a leak) but not the defect itself.

## Next Steps

1. **Document** any defects you're aware of
2. **Check** your building's completion date and warranty status
3. **Engage** a building consultant if significant issues
4. **Notify** the builder promptly if within warranty
5. **Seek** legal advice for complex matters
6. **Report** to owners and keep them informed
