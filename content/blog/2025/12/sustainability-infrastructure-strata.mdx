# New Sustainability Rules for NSW Strata (2025)

The 2025 NSW strata reforms include significant provisions to make it easier for strata schemes to adopt sustainable infrastructure. From electric vehicle charging to solar panels, these changes recognise that strata buildings must play a role in Australia's sustainability transition.

## Why These Reforms Matter

### The Challenge

Strata schemes have historically faced barriers to sustainability:

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Complex approvals** | Difficult to get owner agreement |
| **Unclear processes** | Uncertainty about who pays, who benefits |
| **Common property issues** | Individual improvements on shared space |
| **Cost allocation** | Fair distribution of costs and benefits |
| **Building constraints** | Older buildings not designed for new technology |

### The Opportunity

The 2025 reforms provide:

- Clearer pathways for installations
- Modified voting thresholds for some works
- Framework for individual and collective improvements
- Guidance on cost allocation

<Info>
These reforms don't mandate sustainability measures—they make it easier for schemes that want to pursue them.

## Electric Vehicle Charging

### The Growing Demand

EV ownership is increasing rapidly, creating pressure on strata schemes to provide charging options. The reforms address:

- Individual lot owner installations
- Common area charging stations
- Cost allocation and metering
- Approval processes

### Individual Lot Owner Charging

If you want charging for your own car space:

| Aspect | What the Reforms Provide |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Right to request** | Owners can request permission |
| **Assessment process** | Committee must consider reasonably |
| **Refusal grounds** | Limited grounds for rejection |
| **Cost allocation** | Owner typically pays own costs |
| **Electricity metering** | Must arrange separate metering |

### Process for Individual Installation

1. **Submit request** to the committee with details of proposed installation
2. **Committee assesses** safety, electrical capacity, common property impact
3. **Approval conditions** may be set (e.g., qualified installer, insurance)
4. **Installation** by approved contractor
5. **Metering** arranged for electricity costs
6. **Ongoing use** per any conditions

### Common Area Charging Stations

For building-wide EV infrastructure:

| Option | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **User-pays stations** | Multiple EVs, fair allocation |
| **Free charging** | Small schemes, low usage |
| **Subscription model** | Regular users |
| **Third-party operator** | Hands-off management |

### Voting Requirements

| Type of Work | Voting Threshold |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Individual lot installation** | Committee approval (if no major common property impact) |
| **Minor common infrastructure** | Ordinary resolution |
| **Major electrical upgrade** | May require special resolution |
| **Significant spending** | Per normal financial thresholds |

<Tip>
Get electrical capacity assessed early. Many older buildings need switchboard upgrades to support multiple EV chargers.
</Tip>

## Solar Panels and Renewable Energy

### Common Property Installations

Installing solar on building roofs:

| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Ownership** | Typically becomes common property |
| **Benefits** | Reduced common area electricity costs |
| **Voting** | Usually ordinary resolution |
| **Funding** | Capital works fund or special levy |
| **Maintenance** | Owners corporation responsibility |

### Sizing Considerations

| Usage | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| **Common areas only** | Size to offset common electricity |
| **Export/credits** | May size larger for income |
| **Battery storage** | Consider for maximising benefit |

### Approval Process

1. **Feasibility study** - Assess roof capacity, shading, orientation
2. **Quotes** - Multiple installer quotes
3. **Financial analysis** - Payback period, savings projections
4. **General meeting** - Resolution to proceed
5. **Installation** - By approved installer
6. **Grid connection** - Application to electricity distributor
7. **Ongoing management** - Monitoring and maintenance

### Virtual Energy Sharing

Emerging models allow:

- Individual owners to purchase shares in common solar
- Allocation of benefits based on contribution
- More complex but potentially fairer

## Energy Efficiency Improvements

### Building-Wide Upgrades

Common energy efficiency measures:

| Measure | Typical Savings |
|---------|-----------------|
| **LED lighting** | 50-80% of lighting costs |
| **Sensor controls** | 20-40% additional |
| **HVAC upgrades** | 20-40% of cooling/heating |
| **Insulation** | Variable, often significant |
| **Double glazing** | 25-50% of heating/cooling |

### Approval Pathways

| Improvement | Typical Approval |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Like-for-like replacement** | Committee (maintenance) |
| **Minor upgrades** | Committee or ordinary resolution |
| **Major works** | Ordinary or special resolution |
| **Appearance changes** | Special resolution likely |

### Funding Options

| Source | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Capital works fund** | Planned improvements |
| **Special levy** | Larger projects |
| **Strata loan** | Significant investments |
| **Government grants** | If available for your project |
| **Energy savings** | Repayment from reduced costs |

## Sustainability Planning

### Developing a Sustainability Plan

Consider creating a building sustainability strategy:

| Component | What to Include |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Current state** | Existing sustainability features |
| **Opportunities** | Potential improvements |
| **Priorities** | What to tackle first |
| **Costs** | Estimated investment required |
| **Benefits** | Expected savings, other benefits |
| **Timeline** | When to implement |

### Priority Areas

For most strata buildings:

| Priority | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **1. Common area lighting** | Quick wins, low cost |
| **2. HVAC efficiency** | Often largest energy use |
| **3. Solar (if suitable)** | Good returns, visible impact |
| **4. EV readiness** | Preparing for demand |
| **5. Major upgrades** | Longer-term planning |

<Warning>
Not all buildings are suitable for all measures. Get professional assessment before committing to major investments.
</Warning>

## Cost Allocation

### Fairness Principles

The reforms encourage fair cost allocation:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **User pays** | Those who benefit pay more |
| **Proportional** | Based on unit entitlements for shared benefits |
| **Capacity to pay** | Consider hardship provisions |
| **Transparency** | Clear about how costs are allocated |

### EV Charging Costs

| Cost Type | Who Pays |
|-----------|----------|
| **Individual charger** | Lot owner |
| **Electrical upgrade** | May be shared if benefits all |
| **Electricity used** | User (via metering) |
| **Common station** | All owners or users |

### Solar Panel Benefits

Options for distributing benefits:

| Model | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Common costs reduction** | Lower levies for all |
| **Export credits shared** | Proportional to UE |
| **Funding repayment** | Pay back capital investment first |

## Common Questions and Challenges

### "We can't get agreement"

Strategies to build support:

- Present clear cost-benefit analysis
- Start with low-cost, high-impact items
- Share examples from similar schemes

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the committee refuse my EV charger request?

The reforms limit grounds for refusal. If your installation meets safety requirements and you pay all costs, refusal is difficult to justify. Document unreasonable refusals.

### Who pays for electrical upgrades needed for EV chargers?

This depends on circumstances. If upgrades benefit only you, you may pay. If multiple owners benefit or it's building-wide, costs may be shared.

### Can I install solar panels on my own roof (townhouse)?

Check your strata plan. The roof may be common property even in townhouse schemes. You'll likely need owners corporation approval.

### Do we need a by-law for EV charging?

Not required, but a by-law can clarify rules, costs, and conditions. Consider developing one as EV demand grows.

### What happens if I sell my lot with an EV charger installed?

Generally, fixtures remain with the property. Document the installation clearly so new owners know it exists and how it's metered.

### Are there grants available for strata sustainability?

Grants change frequently. Check federal and NSW government programs, local council initiatives, and energy retailer offers.

## Next Steps
