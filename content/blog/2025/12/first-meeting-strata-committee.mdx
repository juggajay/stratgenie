# Your First Meeting as a Strata Committee Member

Congratulations on joining your strata committee. Whether you volunteered or were convinced by neighbours, you're now helping manage your building. This guide will help you navigate your first meeting with confidence.

## Before the Meeting

### Get the Essentials

Request these documents from the secretary:

| Document | Why You Need It |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Strata plan** | Shows lot boundaries, common property |
| **Current by-laws** | The rules governing your scheme |
| **Recent AGM minutes** | Key decisions and context |
| **Latest financial statements** | Current financial position |
| **Committee contact list** | Who's who on the committee |
| **Outstanding matters list** | Current issues being addressed |

### Understand Your Role

The strata committee:

- Makes day-to-day decisions between general meetings
- Implements AGM resolutions
- Manages the scheme within its delegated authority
- Reports to owners at general meetings

<Info>
The committee acts on behalf of all owners, not just committee members. Your duty is to the whole owners corporation.
</Info>

### Know the Key Positions

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Chairperson** | Runs meetings, casts deciding vote if tied |
| **Secretary** | Correspondence, records, notices |
| **Treasurer** | Financial management, reporting |
| **Ordinary members** | Participate in all decisions |

Any committee member can hold any position—or multiple positions in small schemes.

## What to Expect

### Meeting Structure

A typical committee meeting follows this flow:

1. **Opening** - Confirm quorum, apologies
2. **Previous minutes** - Confirm accuracy
3. **Matters arising** - Update on previous items
4. **Correspondence** - Review incoming/outgoing
5. **Financial report** - Treasurer's update
6. **New business** - Current issues and decisions
7. **General business** - Other matters raised
8. **Next meeting** - Set date
9. **Close**

### Quorum Requirements

For decisions to be valid:

| Committee Size | Quorum |
|----------------|--------|
| **3 members** | 2 |
| **4-5 members** | 3 |
| **6-7 members** | 4 |
| **8-9 members** | 5 |

<Warning>
Without quorum, the meeting can discuss matters but cannot make binding decisions.
</Warning>

### Decision Making

Most committee decisions are made by:

- **Simple majority** - More than half of those present
- **Show of hands** - Unless someone requests a ballot
- **Recorded in minutes** - All resolutions documented

## Your First Meeting Survival Guide

### Before You Arrive

- [ ] Read the agenda and attachments
- [ ] Note any questions you have
- [ ] Review any previous minutes provided
- [ ] Know the meeting time and location
- [ ] Bring something to take notes

### During the Meeting

**Do:**
- Listen before speaking
- Ask questions if you don't understand
- Take notes on decisions and actions
- Contribute when you have relevant input
- Respect other members' views

**Don't:**
- Dominate the discussion
- Make commitments on behalf of the committee
- Bring personal disputes into committee business
- Vote on matters where you have a conflict

### After the Meeting

- Review your notes while fresh
- Complete any actions assigned to you
- Follow up on questions you had
- Keep meeting discussions confidential

<Tip>
If you're assigned an action, set a reminder and complete it before the next meeting. Reliability builds trust.
</Tip>

## Common First-Meeting Questions

### Can I vote on everything?

You can vote on all matters except where you have a **conflict of interest**. For example:

- A decision about your lot specifically
- Hiring a contractor you're related to
- Approving a by-law that benefits only you

Declare the conflict and abstain from voting.

### What if I disagree with the majority?

You can:

- Express your view and have it noted in minutes
- Vote against the motion
- Accept the majority decision professionally

The committee operates by majority rule. Once a decision is made, the committee should present a united front.

### Can I discuss committee matters with other owners?

Be careful:

| OK to Share | Keep Confidential |
|-------------|-------------------|
| General progress updates | Individual owner matters |
| Decisions once finalised | Deliberations and debates |
| Published minutes | Quotes and pricing details |
| General direction | Legal advice received |

### What authority do I have individually?

Very limited. Individual committee members cannot:

- Commit the scheme to expenses
- Direct contractors
- Speak officially for the owners corporation
- Make decisions outside meetings

All decisions must be made collectively at meetings.

## Understanding Committee Dynamics

### Working with Different Personalities

Committees bring together different people:

| Type | How to Work Together |
|------|---------------------|
| **The Expert** | Value their knowledge, ensure others contribute |
| **The Enthusiast** | Channel their energy productively |
| **The Skeptic** | Appreciate their scrutiny, address concerns |
| **The Quiet One** | Draw out their input, they often have insights |
| **The Busy One** | Assign clear, bounded tasks |

### When Disagreements Arise

Handle conflicts professionally:

1. Focus on issues, not personalities
2. Seek to understand other views
3. Look for compromise or middle ground
4. Accept majority decisions gracefully
5. Don't carry grievances beyond the meeting

## Key Things to Learn

### Priority Knowledge

Focus on understanding these first:

| Priority | Topic |
|----------|-------|
| **High** | Current building issues |
| **High** | Financial position and budget |
| **High** | Insurance coverage |
| **Medium** | By-laws and their enforcement |
| **Medium** | Contractor arrangements |
| **Medium** | Capital works plan |
| **Lower** | Historical issues (resolved) |

### Where to Find Information

| Information | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| Strata law | NSW Fair Trading website |
| Your scheme specifics | Strata plan, by-laws |
| Financial details | Treasurer, statements |
| Building history | Previous minutes, secretary |
| Industry guidance | Strata community websites |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long is my term?

Committee members serve until the next AGM, when a new committee is elected. You can stand for re-election.

### Can I resign mid-term?

Yes. Notify the secretary in writing. The committee can continue with remaining members or co-opt a replacement.

### What if I'm related to another committee member?

This is allowed, but both must declare conflicts of interest appropriately. In small schemes, related members are common.

### Do I get paid?

No. Committee members are volunteers. However, the scheme should reimburse genuine out-of-pocket expenses (with committee approval).

### What's my liability as a committee member?

You have duties of care, disclosure, and good faith. Acting honestly and reasonably protects you. Most schemes have office bearers liability insurance for additional protection.
