# Special Levies in Strata: When and How to Raise Them in NSW

Sometimes your regular levies aren't enough. Whether it's unexpected repairs, a major project, or catching up on deferred maintenance, a special levy may be necessary. This guide explains when and how to raise one properly.

## What Is a Special Levy?

A special levy is a one-time or limited contribution raised for a specific purpose, separate from regular quarterly levies. Unlike regular levies that cover ongoing operating costs, special levies fund particular projects or address specific financial needs.

### Characteristics of Special Levies

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Specific, defined use |
| **Duration** | One-time or limited period |
| **Amount** | Calculated for the project |
| **Approval** | Requires general meeting resolution |
| **Distribution** | Based on unit entitlements |

## When to Raise a Special Levy

### Common Reasons

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Major repairs** | Roof replacement, facade work |
| **Emergency works** | Urgent safety repairs |
| **Defect remediation** | Waterproofing, structural repairs |
| **Building upgrades** | Lift modernisation, solar panels |
| **Capital works shortfall** | Catching up on underfunding |
| **Unexpected costs** | Insurance excess, legal fees |
| **Compliance works** | Fire safety upgrades |

### When NOT to Use Special Levies

Consider alternatives for:

- **Routine maintenance** - Should be in regular budget
- **Small amounts** - May not justify process overhead
- **Ongoing costs** - Better to adjust regular levies
- **Non-urgent items** - Can be planned and funded gradually

<Tip>
A well-maintained capital works fund reduces the need for special levies. Regular contributions and good planning mean fewer surprises.
</Tip>

## The Resolution Process

### Step 1: Determine the Amount

Calculate the total needed:

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Project cost** | $150,000 |
| **Contingency (10-15%)** | $15,000 |
| **Professional fees** | $10,000 |
| **GST (if applicable)** | $17,500 |
| **Total required** | $192,500 |

### Step 2: Check Existing Funds

Review what's available:

| Fund | Balance | Available? |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Capital works fund** | $50,000 | Yes |
| **Administrative fund** | $20,000 | Possibly (surplus only) |
| **Special purpose reserve** | $0 | N/A |

**Net special levy required:** $192,500 - $50,000 = $142,500

### Step 3: Calculate Per-Lot Contributions

Special levies are based on unit entitlements:

```
Lot contribution = Total levy × (Lot UE / Total UE)

Example:
- Total special levy: $142,500
- Total unit entitlements: 1,000
- Lot with 50 UE: $142,500 × (50/1,000) = $7,125
```

### Step 4: Draft the Motion

The motion should include:

- **Amount** to be raised
- **Purpose** (specific, not vague)
- **Payment terms** (lump sum or instalments)
- **Due date(s)**
- **Which fund** it goes into

**Sample motion:**

> THAT a special levy of $142,500 be raised for the purpose of roof replacement and waterproofing works at [address], to be paid into the capital works fund, in two equal instalments due 30 June 2025 and 30 September 2025, in accordance with unit entitlements.

### Step 5: Call a General Meeting

Special levies require a general meeting resolution:

| Meeting Type | When Appropriate |
|--------------|------------------|
| **AGM** | If timing aligns, include on agenda |
| **EGM** | If urgent or between AGMs |

<Warning>
The committee cannot approve a special levy on its own authority. A general meeting resolution is required.
</Warning>

### Notice Requirements

Provide adequate notice:

- **14 days minimum** for most schemes
- **21 days** for schemes with 100+ lots
- Include full motion text
- Explain the purpose and need
- Provide supporting documentation

### Step 6: Hold the Meeting

At the meeting:

1. Present the need for the special levy
2. Show quotes and documentation
3. Answer owner questions
4. Take the vote
5. Record the resolution

### Voting Requirements

| Resolution Type | Votes Required |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Ordinary resolution** | Simple majority |
| **Special resolution** | Not usually required for levies |

Most special levies pass by ordinary resolution. Some schemes specify higher thresholds in by-laws.

## Collection Strategies

### Payment Options

Offer flexibility where possible:

| Option | When Suitable |
|--------|---------------|
| **Lump sum** | Small amounts, short timeframe |
| **Two instalments** | Medium amounts |
| **Quarterly over year** | Large amounts |
| **Multiple years** | Very large projects |

### Setting Due Dates

Consider:

- Time needed to collect before work starts
- Alignment with regular levy dates
- Owner cash flow (avoid December/January)
- Project timeline requirements

### Payment Methods

Accept multiple payment methods:

- BPAY
- Direct bank transfer
- Credit card (with fee disclosure)
- Direct debit plan
- Cheque (declining use)

### Financial Hardship

Remember the 2025 requirements:

- Include Financial Hardship Information Statement
- Consider payment plan requests
- Document any arrangements

See our [Levy Payment Plans Guide](/blog/strata-levy-payment-plans-nsw).

## Managing the Project

### Separate Tracking

Keep special levy funds distinct:

- Deposit into capital works fund
- Track against specific project
- Report separately to owners
- Account for any surplus or shortfall

### Contractor Payments

Manage payments carefully:

| Stage | Payment |
|-------|---------|
| **Contract signing** | Deposit (10-20% typical) |
| **Progress milestones** | Per contract terms |
| **Practical completion** | Major payment |
| **Final completion** | Retention release |

### Reporting

Keep owners informed:

- Regular project updates
- Financial status reports
- Explanation of any variations
- Final accounting on completion

## What If There's a Surplus?

If the project costs less than raised:

| Option | How to Implement |
|--------|------------------|
| **Keep in capital works** | Usually best—prepares for future |
| **Refund to owners** | Complex, rarely done |
| **Apply to next project** | If related work planned |
| **General meeting decision** | Let owners decide |

<Info>
Most schemes keep any surplus in the capital works fund. It offsets future levies and provides a buffer.
</Info>

## What If There's a Shortfall?

If the project costs more than raised:

1. **Use capital works fund surplus** (if available)
2. **Raise additional special levy**
3. **Arrange finance** (loan, payment terms with contractor)
4. **Reduce project scope** (if possible without compromising outcome)

### Avoiding Shortfalls

- Include adequate contingency (10-15%)
- Get multiple quotes
- Fix price where possible
- Allow for variations in resolution

## Alternative Funding Options

### Strata Finance

Some schemes borrow rather than levy:

| Strata Loan | Special Levy |
|-------------|--------------|
| Immediate access to funds | Wait for collection |
| Interest cost | No interest |
| Fixed repayments | One-time payment |
| Spreads cost over time | Immediate burden on owners |
| May require security | No security needed |

### Sinking Fund Contributions

For non-urgent future works:

- Increase regular capital works levy
- Build fund over several years
- Avoid large one-time hit on owners

### Insurance Claims

If damage is covered:

- Make insurance claim first
- Special levy only for excess/shortfall
- Consider whether premium increase is worthwhile

## Common Mistakes

### Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vague purpose** | Resolution may be challenged |
| **No quotes** | Owners may reject |
| **Too little** | Shortfall and second levy needed |
| **Too much** | Owner resistance, surplus issues |
| **Short payment time** | Hardship, arrears |
| **No meeting** | Invalid levy |

### Getting It Right

- Be specific about purpose
- Have quotes and documentation ready
- Include realistic contingency
- Allow reasonable payment time
- Hold proper meeting with notice

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the committee raise a special levy without a meeting?

No. Special levies require approval by resolution at a general meeting (AGM or EGM). The committee cannot unilaterally impose special levies.

### Can owners vote against a special levy for necessary repairs?

They can vote, but if the work is necessary for compliance, safety, or building preservation, the committee may need to proceed anyway and seek NCAT intervention if owners are unreasonably blocking essential work.

### Can I pay my special levy in instalments if the resolution specifies lump sum?

Formally, you should pay as required. However, you can request a payment plan under the Financial Hardship provisions. The committee should consider reasonable requests.

### What if an owner refuses to pay their special levy?

The same debt recovery process applies as for regular levies. The owners corporation can charge interest and pursue recovery through NCAT.

### Does a special levy increase the value of my lot?

Major improvements may increase value, but generally, special levies maintain or restore value rather than creating new value. They're often seen as addressing deferred maintenance.

### Can special levies be tax-deductible?

For investment properties, capital works levies may be depreciable over time. Consult your accountant—tax treatment varies based on the nature of works.

## Next Steps

1. **Assess** whether a special levy is the right approach
2. **Calculate** the full amount needed with contingency
3. **Draft** a clear, specific motion
4. **Call** a general meeting with proper notice
5. **Present** supporting documentation to owners
6. **Offer** reasonable payment terms
7. **Track** and report on fund usage
