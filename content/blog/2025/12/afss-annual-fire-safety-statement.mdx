Fire safety is one of the most critical compliance obligations for NSW strata schemes. The Annual Fire Safety Statement (AFSS) is your building's yearly certification that essential fire safety measures are working correctly.

## What is an Annual Fire Safety Statement?

An AFSS is a document that certifies your building's essential fire safety measures have been:
- Assessed by a qualified person
- Found to be capable of performing to at least minimum standards
- Properly maintained throughout the year

<Danger>
Failure to lodge an AFSS can result in penalties up to $110,000 and potential personal liability for committee members if a fire incident occurs.
</Danger>

## Who Needs to Submit an AFSS?

Buildings that require an AFSS include:
- Buildings with a fire safety schedule
- Most strata schemes with three or more storeys
- Buildings with certain fire safety installations
- Mixed-use developments

Your building likely needs an AFSS if it has:
- Fire sprinkler systems
- Fire hydrants or hose reels
- Smoke detection and alarm systems
- Emergency lighting
- Exit signs
- Fire doors
- Mechanical ventilation systems

<Tip>
Check your building's Fire Safety Schedule (issued with the Occupation Certificate) to see which essential fire safety measures require annual certification.

## The AFSS Process

### Step 1: Engage Qualified Assessors

You need:
- **Accredited practitioners** for complex systems (sprinklers, hydrants)
- **Competent fire safety practitioners** for other measures
- **Licensed contractors** with appropriate qualifications

### Step 2: Conduct Assessments

Assessors will:
- Inspect each essential fire safety measure
- Test functionality where applicable
- Compare performance to the Fire Safety Schedule
- Identify any deficiencies

### Step 3: Address Deficiencies

If issues are found:
- Repairs must be completed before AFSS can be issued
- Some minor deficiencies may be noted with a compliance plan
- Critical safety issues require immediate action

### Step 4: Prepare the AFSS

The AFSS must include:
- Building address and details
- List of all essential fire safety measures
- Certification that measures meet minimum standards
- Date of assessment
- Practitioner's details and signature

### Step 5: Lodge with Council and Fire & Rescue NSW

Submit your AFSS to:
- Local council (usually online or by mail)
- Fire & Rescue NSW
- Keep a copy for your records

<Warning>
The AFSS must be lodged within 12 months of the previous statement or the anniversary of the fire safety certificate. Missing the deadline triggers penalties.
</Warning>

## Choosing Fire Safety Contractors

### Qualifications to Look For
- Current accreditation for the systems they assess
- Public liability and professional indemnity insurance
- Experience with strata buildings
- Fire & Rescue NSW registration (for certain work)

### Questions to Ask
1. What accreditations do you hold?
2. How long have you been servicing strata buildings?
3. Can you provide references from similar schemes?
4. What's included in your service agreement?
5. How do you handle emergency call-outs?

### Red Flags
- No formal qualifications or accreditation
- Unusually low quotes (may indicate shortcuts)
- No written reports or documentation
- Reluctance to provide references

## Record Keeping Requirements

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I find my AFSS due date?

Check your Occupation Certificate or previous AFSS. The due date is typically the anniversary of when the building was first occupied or the fire safety certificate was issued.

### Can we lodge the AFSS ourselves?

The AFSS must be prepared by a qualified person who has assessed the fire safety measures. However, the building owner (owners corporation) is responsible for lodging it.

### What happens if we can't afford the repairs?

Fire safety isn't optional. Consider a special levy if standard funds are insufficient. Delaying repairs could result in higher penalties and insurance issues.

### Do we need separate assessors for different systems?

Yes, different fire safety measures require different qualifications. Sprinkler systems, for example, require a specifically accredited practitioner.

### What if our building is very old?

Older buildings may have different requirements based on when they were built. However, any existing fire safety measures must be maintained to current standards.
