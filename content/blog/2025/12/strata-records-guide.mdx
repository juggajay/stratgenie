# Strata Records: What to Keep and For How Long in NSW

Proper record-keeping is fundamental to running a compliant strata scheme. NSW law mandates specific documents that must be maintained, with strict retention periods and accessibility requirements. This guide explains your obligations.

## Why Record-Keeping Matters

Good records protect your scheme by:

- **Demonstrating compliance** with statutory obligations
- **Supporting decisions** with documented rationale
- **Resolving disputes** with clear evidence
- **Enabling transitions** when committee members change
- **Facilitating audits** and financial reviews

<Warning>
Failure to maintain required records can result in penalties and may invalidate certain scheme decisions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long must we keep meeting minutes?

Meeting minutes should be kept permanently. They form the historical record of scheme decisions and may be needed to verify past actions or resolve disputes years later.

### Can we keep records only in digital format?

Yes, NSW law permits electronic record-keeping provided the records are readily accessible, legible, and can be reproduced in paper form if required.

### What if previous committees didn't keep proper records?

Document what records you have, note what's missing, and implement proper systems going forward. Consider reconstructing critical records from alternative sources like bank statements.

### Do we need to keep superseded by-laws?

Yes. Historical by-laws may be relevant to understanding past decisions or resolving disputes about what rules applied at particular times.

### Can owners take photos of records?

Generally yes. Owners have a right to inspect records, and taking photos is a reasonable method of recording information during inspection.

## Next Steps

1. **Audit** your current records against this checklist
2. **Identify** any gaps in documentation
3. **Implement** a filing system (physical and digital)
4. **Create** a retention schedule
5. **Brief** committee members on procedures
6. **Schedule** annual records reviews
