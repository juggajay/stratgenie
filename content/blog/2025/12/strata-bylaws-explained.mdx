By-laws are the rules that govern daily life in your strata scheme. They determine everything from whether you can have pets to how late you can play music. Understanding by-laws is essential for peaceful strata living in NSW.

## What Are Strata By-Laws?

By-laws are legally binding rules that apply to everyone in a strata scheme—owners, tenants, and visitors. They're designed to:

- Protect common property
- Ensure peaceful enjoyment of all lots
- Establish clear responsibilities
- Manage shared facilities fairly

<Tip>
By-laws are registered with NSW Land Registry Services and bind all current and future owners. They're not just guidelines—they're enforceable rules with real consequences.
</Tip>

## Model By-Laws: Your Starting Point

Every strata scheme in NSW starts with a set of model by-laws from the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015. These cover:

### 1. Noise and Behaviour
- No unreasonable noise at any time
- No behaviour likely to interfere with peaceful enjoyment
- Specific quiet hours (usually 10 PM to 8 AM)

### 2. Common Property Use
- Keep common areas clean and tidy
- No obstruction of common areas
- Use facilities for intended purposes only

### 3. Damage and Maintenance
- Promptly repair damage caused by you or your guests
- Report maintenance issues to the strata committee
- Allow reasonable access for repairs

### 4. Vehicle Parking
- Park only in designated areas
- Don't obstruct other vehicles
- Keep vehicles registered and roadworthy

### 5. Appearance and Modifications
- No changes to external appearance without approval
- Maintain lots in good repair
- No hanging items outside in a way that affects appearance

## Common Additional By-Laws

Many schemes adopt additional by-laws beyond the models:

### Pets
The default position in NSW is that pets **are allowed** unless a by-law specifically restricts them. Common pet by-laws include:
- Requiring approval before keeping pets
- Limiting number or type of pets
- Requiring pets to be leashed in common areas
- Prohibiting pets from certain facilities (pools, gyms)

<Warning>
A blanket ban on all pets is no longer valid in NSW. Any pet by-law must be reasonable and cannot prohibit all animals. Assistance animals cannot be banned under any circumstances.
</Warning>

### Short-Term Letting (Airbnb)
Schemes can now regulate short-term letting:
- Building can be designated as short-term letting prohibited
- Minimum stay requirements
- Registration and key management rules
- Guest behaviour standards

### Smoking
By-laws can restrict smoking:
- In common areas (very common)
- On balconies (increasingly common)
- Within lots if smoke drifts to common areas (more complex)

### Renovations
- Approval processes for modifications
- Working hours restrictions
- Noise limitations during work
- Contractor requirements (insurance, licenses)

### Moving In/Out
- Booking requirements for lifts
- Permitted moving hours
- Damage bonds
- Notification requirements

## How By-Laws Are Created and Changed

### Creating New By-Laws

To create a new by-law, you need:
1. **Special Resolution** - 75% of votes at a general meeting
2. **Proper Notice** - Motion included in meeting agenda
3. **Registration** - Lodged with NSW Land Registry Services
4. **Reasonableness** - Must not be harsh, unconscionable, or oppressive

### Changing Existing By-Laws

The same process applies:
1. Propose the change at a general meeting
2. Pass by special resolution (75%)
3. Register the amended by-law

### Repealing By-Laws

By-laws can be removed by:
1. Special resolution to repeal
2. Registration of the repeal

<Info>
Changes to by-laws don't take effect until registered with NSW Land Registry Services. The registration process can take several weeks.
</Info>

## Enforcing By-Laws

### Step 1: Informal Resolution
- Speak directly with the person
- Document the conversation
- Allow reasonable time to comply

### Step 2: Notice to Comply
- Formal written notice from the strata committee
- Specifies the breach and required action
- Sets a reasonable timeframe for compliance

### Step 3: Penalty Notice
- If breach continues, a penalty notice can be issued
- Maximum penalty: $1,100 for occupiers, $2,200 for owners corporation
- Must follow correct procedures

### Step 4: NCAT Application
- If penalties don't resolve the issue
- Apply to NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal
- Tribunal can order compliance and impose further penalties

## What By-Laws Cannot Do

By-laws have limits. They cannot:

### Prohibit What the Law Allows
- Blanket pet bans (unreasonable)
- Banning children
- Discriminating against certain groups

### Be Harsh or Oppressive
- Excessive fines beyond legal limits
- Unreasonable restrictions on lot use
- Rules that unfairly target specific lots

### Override Other Laws
- Planning laws
- Building codes
- Anti-discrimination legislation
- Work health and safety requirements

### Affect Things Outside the Scheme
- Public roads or footpaths
- Neighbouring properties
- Council land

<Danger>
If you believe a by-law is invalid or unreasonable, you can challenge it at NCAT. However, continue to comply while the challenge is pending unless the Tribunal orders otherwise.
</Danger>

## Your Rights as a Lot Owner

Even with by-laws in place, you have protected rights:

### Right to Quiet Enjoyment
You're entitled to peaceful use of your property, subject to reasonable by-laws.

### Right to Information
You can access by-laws, meeting minutes, and other records.

### Right to Challenge
Unreasonable by-laws can be challenged at NCAT.

### Right to Participate
Vote on by-law changes at general meetings.

### Right to Propose Changes
Any owner can propose by-law amendments.

## Common By-Law Disputes

### Noise Complaints
- Document incidents with dates, times, and descriptions
- Check if noise exceeds what's "reasonable"
- Consider mediation before formal action

### Pet Disputes
- Review the specific pet by-law carefully
- Document any issues (noise, mess, aggression)
- Remember: assistance animals are always allowed

### Parking Issues
- Check by-laws for allocated vs. visitor spaces

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the strata committee create by-laws without a meeting?

No. All by-laws must be passed by special resolution at a general meeting. The committee can propose by-laws but cannot create them unilaterally.

### How do I find out what by-laws apply to my scheme?

Request a copy from your strata committee or strata manager. You can also obtain registered by-laws from NSW Land Registry Services for a fee.

### Can I be fined for a by-law breach I didn't know about?

Technically yes, but NCAT may consider lack of knowledge as a mitigating factor. It's your responsibility to know the by-laws, but schemes should ensure by-laws are accessible to all.

### Do by-laws apply to tenants?

Yes. Tenants must comply with by-laws, and owners are responsible for ensuring their tenants comply. Lease agreements should include by-law requirements.

### Can we change model by-laws?

Yes. Model by-laws can be amended, replaced, or repealed by special resolution, subject to registration requirements.
