# Strata Financial Audit Requirements in NSW

Financial audits provide independent verification that your scheme's finances are properly managed. Understanding when an audit is required and what it involves helps you stay compliant and protect all owners.

## Does Your Scheme Need an Audit?

### Mandatory Audit Threshold

In NSW, strata schemes must have their financial statements audited if:

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Total contributions (levies)** | Exceeds $250,000 per year |
| **Scheme size** | Generally 100+ lots reach this |

<Info>
The $250,000 threshold includes administrative fund and capital works fund contributions combined, but excludes special levies for one-off projects.
</Info>

### Optional Audits

Even if not required, your scheme may choose an audit if:

- Owners request it by resolution
- There are concerns about financial management
- A new treasurer wants independent verification
- The scheme is transitioning from strata management

### Audit vs Review

| Service | What It Provides | Cost |
|---------|------------------|------|
| **Full audit** | Highest assurance, detailed testing | Higher |
| **Review** | Limited assurance, analytical procedures | Lower |
| **Compilation** | No assurance, preparation only | Lowest |

Most schemes needing professional review opt for a review engagement rather than a full audit, which provides reasonable assurance at lower cost.

## What the Auditor Checks

### Financial Statements

The auditor examines:

| Statement | What's Checked |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Income statement** | Levies collected match notices, expenses properly recorded |
| **Balance sheet** | Bank balances verified, assets and liabilities accurate |
| **Cash flow** | Movements reconcile with statements |
| **Fund statements** | Admin and capital works funds properly separated |

### Internal Controls

The auditor assesses whether:

- Appropriate authorisations are in place
- Funds are properly safeguarded
- Records are adequately maintained
- Segregation of duties exists (where possible)

### Specific Tests

| Area | What's Tested |
|------|---------------|
| **Bank reconciliations** | Statements match book balances |
| **Levy collection** | Notices issued, collected, arrears tracked |
| **Expenses** | Properly authorised, documented, recorded |
| **Contracts** | Proper approval, within budget |
| **Insurance** | Coverage adequate and current |
| **Investments** | Properly authorised and recorded |

## Choosing an Auditor

### Who Can Audit?

For mandatory audits:

- **Registered company auditor**, or
- **Qualified accountant** (CPA, CA, IPA member)

<Warning>
Committee members, strata managers, and their relatives cannot audit the scheme's accounts. Independence is essential.
</Warning>

### Finding an Auditor

Options include:

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Strata specialist** | Understands strata-specific issues |
| **Local accountant** | Relationship and accessibility |
| **Larger firm** | Complex schemes |
| **Online services** | Cost-effective, smaller schemes |

### Appointment Process

1. **Committee recommends** an auditor
2. **AGM appoints** by ordinary resolution
3. **Appointment term** - usually annual
4. **Fees agreed** in advance

### Cost Expectations

Typical audit/review fees:

| Scheme Size | Approximate Range |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Small (< 20 lots)** | $800 - $1,500 |
| **Medium (20-50 lots)** | $1,200 - $2,500 |
| **Large (50-100 lots)** | $2,000 - $4,000 |
| **Very large (100+ lots)** | $3,500 - $8,000+ |

These are indicative only—fees vary by complexity and location.

## Preparing for the Audit

### Documentation to Gather

| Category | Documents |
|----------|-----------|
| **Bank** | Statements, reconciliations, certificates |
| **Levies** | Notices, arrears reports, payment records |
| **Expenses** | Invoices, payment authorisations |
| **Contracts** | Major agreements, variations |
| **Insurance** | Policies, certificates of currency |
| **Minutes** | AGM, EGM, committee meetings |
| **By-laws** | Current registered by-laws |
| **Prior year** | Previous audit report, financial statements |

### Preparation Checklist

Before the auditor starts:

- [ ] Bank accounts reconciled to year-end
- [ ] All invoices entered and coded
- [ ] Levy notices match accounting records
- [ ] Arrears list is accurate
- [ ] Committee meeting minutes are complete
- [ ] All funds are properly separated
- [ ] Fixed asset register is current
- [ ] Prior year adjustments are processed

<Tip>
Good preparation reduces audit fees. The less time the auditor spends chasing information, the lower your bill.
</Tip>

## The Audit Process

### Typical Timeline

| Stage | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| **Year-end** | Close books, prepare statements |
| **Documentation** | Gather records (1-2 weeks) |
| **Fieldwork** | Auditor testing (1-2 weeks) |
| **Queries** | Answer questions, provide info |
| **Draft report** | Review for accuracy |
| **Final report** | Sign off (before AGM) |

### Auditor's Report

The report includes:

- **Opinion** - Clean, qualified, or adverse
- **Scope** - What was examined
- **Findings** - Any issues identified
- **Recommendations** - Improvements suggested

### Types of Opinions

| Opinion | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Unqualified (clean)** | Financials are fairly stated |
| **Qualified** | Specific issues but overall OK |
| **Adverse** | Material misstatements exist |
| **Disclaimer** | Cannot form an opinion |

A clean opinion is the goal. Qualified opinions aren't disaster but should be addressed.

## Common Audit Issues

### Frequently Found Problems

| Issue | How to Prevent |
|-------|----------------|
| **Incomplete reconciliations** | Reconcile monthly |
| **Missing invoices** | File systematically |
| **Unauthorised expenses** | Follow approval processes |
| **Levy discrepancies** | Regular arrears reviews |
| **Fund mixing** | Maintain separate accounts |
| **Poor minutes** | Document all decisions |

### Resolving Issues

When auditors identify problems:

1. **Understand** the issue fully
2. **Correct** the immediate problem
3. **Implement** controls to prevent recurrence
4. **Document** what was done
5. **Report** to committee/AGM

## Reporting to Owners

### AGM Requirements

Present at the AGM:

- **Audited financial statements**
- **Auditor's report**
- **Management response** to any findings
- **Comparison** to budget
- **Explanation** of significant variances

### Transparency

Good practice includes:

- Making statements available before AGM
- Explaining any qualified opinions
- Answering owner questions
- Addressing auditor recommendations

## Self-Managed Scheme Considerations

### Higher Scrutiny

Without a strata manager, self-managed schemes face:

- Greater reliance on volunteer capacity
- Less segregation of duties
- Higher audit risk

### Compensating Controls

Implement:

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Dual signatories** | No single person can pay |
| **Regular reporting** | Committee oversight |
| **Independent bank review** | Another member checks statements |
| **Rotating roles** | Fresh eyes on processes |
| **Detailed minutes** | Record all approvals |

### When to Get Professional Help

Consider engaging a bookkeeper or accountant for:

- Complex financial situations
- High transaction volumes
- Limited volunteer capacity
- Previous audit issues

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the treasurer prepare the accounts they're audited on?

Yes, but the auditor must verify independently. The treasurer prepares, the auditor checks. This is normal and acceptable.

### What if we're below the threshold but want an audit?

You can resolve at a general meeting to have an audit or review. This provides owners with additional assurance.

### Can we change auditors mid-year?

Yes, but it's unusual and may raise questions. If changing, ensure proper handover of records and explanation of reasons.

### What if the auditor finds fraud?

The auditor will report to the committee. Depending on severity, this may involve:
- Internal investigation
- Police report
- Legal action
- Insurance claim (fidelity guarantee)

### Are virtual audits acceptable?

Yes. Many audits are now conducted remotely with digital documentation. Ensure secure sharing of financial records.

### How long must we keep audit records?

Financial records: 7 years minimum. Audit reports: Permanently (they're part of scheme history).

## Reducing Audit Costs

### Strategies

1. **Good records** - Less auditor time = lower fees
2. **Preparation** - Have everything ready
3. **Fixed quote** - Agree fees upfront
4. **Combined services** - Tax and audit with same accountant
5. **Digital records** - Easy access, less handling

### Red Flags for High Fees

Be wary if:

- Scope keeps expanding without explanation
- Fees significantly exceed quote
- Auditor requests same documents repeatedly
- Process extends unreasonably

## Next Steps

1. **Determine** if your scheme requires an audit
2. **Appoint** an appropriate auditor at your AGM
3. **Implement** good record-keeping practices
4. **Prepare** documentation before audit starts
5. **Address** any findings promptly
6. **Report** clearly to owners
