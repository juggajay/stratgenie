# Strata Committee Roles and Responsibilities Explained

Every strata committee needs people to take on specific roles. Understanding what each position involves helps you decide where you can contribute and ensures your scheme runs smoothly.

## The Office-Bearer Positions

NSW strata law provides for three office-bearer positions, plus ordinary committee members:

| Position | Required? | Typical Workload |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Chairperson** | Yes | Low-medium |
| **Secretary** | Yes | High |
| **Treasurer** | Yes | Medium-high |
| **Ordinary members** | Optional | Low-medium |

<Info>
In small schemes, one person can hold multiple positions. It's common to see combined Secretary/Treasurer roles, or even all three positions held by one committed volunteer.

## Chairperson

### Core Responsibilities

The Chairperson:

- Presides over committee and general meetings

## Ordinary Committee Members

### Role

Ordinary members:

- Participate in committee meetings
- Vote on all decisions
- May take on specific tasks
- Share the committee workload
- Bring diverse perspectives

### Common Delegations

Ordinary members often take responsibility for:

| Area | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| **Building coordinator** | Liaising with contractors, inspecting works |
| **Compliance officer** | Tracking deadlines, insurance, fire safety |
| **Communications** | Owner updates, noticeboard, digital platforms |
| **By-laws** | Monitoring compliance, handling breaches |
| **Gardens/grounds** | Overseeing landscaping, common areas |

### Time Commitment

**Low to medium**—depends on any delegated responsibilities. All members should attend meetings and read papers.

## How Roles Work Together

### Typical Division

| Task | Primary | Support |
|------|---------|---------|
| Running meetings | Chairperson | Secretary |
| Meeting notices | Secretary | - |
| Minutes | Secretary | - |
| Levy notices | Treasurer | Secretary |
| Payments | Treasurer | Committee approval |
| Correspondence | Secretary | All members |
| Building issues | Building coordinator | All members |
| Decisions | All members | - |

### Communication Flow

```
Owners ←→ Secretary ←→ Committee ←→ Contractors
                          ↓
                      Treasurer (finances)
```

### Checks and Balances

| Control | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Dual signatories** | Treasurer + another for payments |
| **Committee approval** | Major expenses need resolution |
| **Financial reporting** | Regular visibility to all |
| **AGM accountability** | Report to all owners annually |

## Electing Office Bearers

### When Elections Occur

- At the first committee meeting after each AGM
- If a position becomes vacant mid-term
- If the committee resolves to change

### Election Process

1. Chairperson position filled first (outgoing chair or nominee presides)
2. Nominations called for each position
3. If contested, vote by committee members
4. Successful candidate assumes role immediately

### Can Someone Refuse a Role?

Yes. No one can be forced to accept a position. If no one is willing to take a required role, the committee may need to:

- Seek volunteers from other owners
- Consider professional assistance
- Report the situation to the AGM

## Combining Roles

### Common Combinations

| Combination | When Suitable |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Secretary + Treasurer** | Small schemes, one capable person |
| **Chairperson + Secretary** | Smaller schemes, experienced member |
| **All three positions** | Very small schemes (2-3 lots) |

### Risks of Combination

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Burnout** | Ensure work is manageable |
| **Single point of failure** | Document procedures, succession planning |
| **Less oversight** | Regular reporting, dual signatories still |

## Delegation and Sub-Committees

### What Can Be Delegated?

The committee can delegate tasks but not ultimate responsibility:

| Can Delegate | Cannot Delegate |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Research and recommendations | Final decisions on major matters |
| Routine administration | Legal obligations |
| Contractor supervision | Financial oversight |
| Owner communications | Meeting conduct |

### Sub-Committees

For specific projects, consider sub-committees:

| Sub-Committee | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Building works** | Oversee major project |
| **Insurance** | Annual review and renewal |
| **By-law review** | Updating scheme rules |
| **Garden** | Landscape management |

Sub-committees recommend; the committee decides.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a non-owner be on the committee?

In NSW, committee members must be owners, mortgagees, or someone with appropriate authority. However, you can engage non-owners as consultants or assistants.

### What if there's a tie in officer elections?

The current or outgoing Chairperson has a casting vote. If electing the Chairperson and there's a tie, lots may be drawn.

### Can office bearers be paid?

Committee members cannot receive payment for their role. However, the scheme can reimburse genuine out-of-pocket expenses (with committee approval).

### How long do I serve?

Office bearer positions are held until the next committee election (typically after each AGM). You can be re-elected indefinitely.

### Can I be removed from a position?

Yes, the committee can resolve to change office bearers at any time. Committee members can also be removed by general meeting resolution.
