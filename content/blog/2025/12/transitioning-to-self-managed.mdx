# How to Transition from Strata Manager to Self-Managed

Transitioning from professional strata management to self-management is a significant decision. Done well, it can save your scheme thousands annually while giving you greater control. Done poorly, it can lead to compliance failures and owner frustration. This guide walks you through the process.

## Is Self-Management Right for Your Scheme?

### Good Candidates for Self-Management

| Factor | Favourable for Self-Management |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Size** | Under 20 lots typically easier |
| **Complexity** | Simple building, few issues |
| **Committee** | Willing, capable volunteers |
| **Owner relations** | Generally harmonious |
| **Building age** | Newer (fewer maintenance issues) |

### Warning Signs

Self-management may be challenging if:

- Ongoing disputes between owners
- Complex building systems (large lift, HVAC)
- Significant capital works underway
- No willing volunteers for key roles
- History of poor governance

<Warning>
Self-management requires committed volunteers. If no one wants to take on responsibilities, keeping a manager may be the better choice.
</Warning>

## The Decision Process

### Step 1: Committee Discussion

Discuss these questions:

| Question | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| Why change? | Cost savings, control, service issues? |
| Who will do the work? | Specific volunteers identified? |
| What's the timeline? | When does current contract end? |
| What support is needed? | Tools, training, occasional help? |

### Step 2: Cost-Benefit Analysis

Compare costs:

| Item | With Manager | Self-Managed |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Management fees | $X/year | $0 |
| Software/tools | Included | $X/year |
| Bookkeeping | Included | $X/year or volunteer |
| Professional advice | Included | As-needed fees |
| Insurance broker | Often included | Direct or broker fee |
| Time commitment | Low | Significant |

Don't just look at dollar savings—consider the value of your volunteers' time.

### Step 3: Owner Resolution

Terminating a management agreement requires:

- General meeting resolution
- Compliance with notice provisions in contract
- Proper transition planning

## Understanding Your Current Contract

### Key Contract Terms

Review your management agreement for:

| Term | Typical Provision |
|------|-------------------|
| **Notice period** | 1-3 months |
| **Termination rights** | For cause vs. without cause |
| **Handover obligations** | What they must provide |
| **Outstanding fees** | What you owe at termination |
| **Document return** | Timeframe for records |

### Termination Notice

Provide written notice that:

- References the specific agreement
- States the termination date
- Requests orderly handover
- Asks for document return schedule

## Planning the Transition

### Transition Timeline

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **3 months before** | Pass termination resolution |
| **2 months before** | Request complete records list |
| **1 month before** | Set up new bank accounts, systems |
| **2 weeks before** | Begin document handover |
| **Day of transition** | Change bank signatories, update contacts |
| **First month after** | Settle outstanding matters |

### Handover Checklist

Request from your outgoing manager:

**Financial Records**
- [ ] Bank statements for past 7 years
- [ ] Reconciled accounts to handover date
- [ ] Aged debtor list with status
- [ ] Outstanding invoices
- [ ] Budget and actual comparison
- [ ] Audit reports

**Corporate Records**
- [ ] Strata roll (current owner details)
- [ ] By-laws (current registered)
- [ ] Meeting minutes (all general and committee)
- [ ] Correspondence files
- [ ] Insurance certificates and policies
- [ ] Contracts (current and expired)

**Building Records**
- [ ] Strata plan
- [ ] Building specifications
- [ ] Warranty documents
- [ ] Compliance certificates
- [ ] Capital works plan
- [ ] Contractor contact list

**Operational**
- [ ] Keys and access devices
- [ ] Security codes
- [ ] Utility account details
- [ ] Standing contractor arrangements

<Tip>
Get everything in digital format where possible. Physical boxes of papers are harder to search and more easily lost.
</Tip>

## Setting Up Self-Management

### Assigning Responsibilities

Divide duties among committee members:

| Role | Key Responsibilities |
|------|---------------------|
| **Secretary** | Correspondence, meetings, records |
| **Treasurer** | Banking, levies, payments, reporting |
| **Building coordinator** | Maintenance, contractors, keys |
| **Compliance officer** | Insurance, fire safety, Strata Hub |

### Establishing Systems

**Banking**
1. Open new scheme bank accounts
2. Arrange dual-signatory requirements
3. Set up BPAY for levy payments
4. Notify owners of new payment details

**Record Keeping**
1. Set up digital filing system
2. Organise handover documents
3. Establish correspondence procedures
4. Create owner contact database

**Communication**
1. Create scheme email address
2. Set up notice distribution method
3. Establish owner contact preferences
4. Create templates for common notices

### Technology Tools

Consider these for self-managed schemes:

| Need | Options |
|------|---------|
| **Document storage** | Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive |
| **Levy notices** | Word/Excel templates, StrataGenie |
| **Banking** | Business bank account with online access |
| **Meetings** | Zoom, Teams for remote participation |
| **Communication** | Shared email, group messaging |

## Managing Finances

### Setting Up Levy Collection

1. **Issue new levy notices** with updated payment details
2. **Set up BPAY** for easy owner payments
3. **Establish direct debit** options if desired
4. **Create arrears process** and follow consistently

### Payment Procedures

Implement controls:

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Dual signatories** | Prevents single-person fraud |
| **Invoice approval** | Committee reviews before payment |
| **Regular reconciliation** | Verify all transactions |
| **Committee reporting** | Regular financial updates |

### Financial Reporting

Monthly or quarterly, prepare:

- Bank reconciliation
- Levy collection report
- Aged debtor analysis
- Expense summary by category
- Budget vs. actual comparison

## Meeting Management

### Running Effective Meetings

As a self-managed scheme, you must handle:

**AGM**
- Send notices 14+ days ahead
- Prepare financial statements
- Draft agenda and motions
- Manage voting and proxies
- Record and distribute minutes

**Committee Meetings**
- Set regular schedule
- Circulate agenda in advance
- Keep focused, productive
- Record decisions clearly

### Minutes Template

Use a consistent format:

```
MINUTES OF COMMITTEE MEETING
[Scheme Name] - SP [Number]
Date: [Date]
Location: [Place or Online]

Present: [Names]
Apologies: [Names]

1. CONFIRMATION OF MINUTES
   Resolved that the minutes of [date] be confirmed.

2. MATTERS ARISING
   [Updates on previous actions]

3. CORRESPONDENCE
   [Summary of significant items]

4. FINANCIAL REPORT
   [Treasurer's update]

5. MAINTENANCE
   [Building issues and actions]

6. NEW BUSINESS
   [Items for decision]

7. NEXT MEETING
   [Date confirmed]

Meeting closed: [Time]
```

## Ongoing Compliance

### Key Deadlines

Track these annually:

| Obligation | Deadline |
|------------|----------|
| **AGM** | Within 2 months of financial year end |
| **Financial statements** | Ready for AGM |
| **Insurance renewal** | Before policy expires |
| **Fire safety (AFSS)** | Usually annually |
| **Strata Hub update** | After changes |

### Compliance Calendar

Create reminders for:

- AGM planning (start 2 months before)
- Insurance renewal (review 1 month before)
- Fire safety inspection (schedule ahead)
- Strata roll updates (ongoing)
- Capital works fund review (annually)

## Getting Help When Needed

### When to Seek Professional Assistance

| Situation | Who to Consult |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex legal matter | Strata lawyer |
| Building defects | Building consultant |
| Financial questions | Accountant |
| Insurance claims | Insurance broker |
| Disputes | Mediator, Fair Trading |
| Major works | Quantity surveyor, project manager |

### Building a Professional Network

Even self-managed schemes need occasional help. Build relationships with:

- Local strata lawyer
- Accountant with strata experience
- Insurance broker (can use fee-for-service)
- Reliable contractors for common needs

<Info>
The cost savings from self-management can fund professional advice when genuinely needed.

## Common Transition Challenges

### Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Missing records** | Reconstruct from bank statements, owners |
| **Unclear finances** | Commission mini-audit to establish baseline |
| **Owner confusion** | Clear communication about new processes |
| **Volunteer burnout** | Rotate responsibilities, set boundaries |
| **Knowledge gaps** | Training, mentoring, professional advice |

### First-Year Issues

Expect some hiccups:

- Levy collection may take time to normalise
- Some owners won't update payment details promptly
- Processes will need refinement
- You'll discover things the manager didn't tell you

Stay patient and methodical. Most issues are solvable with good communication.

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

Track these to assess how you're doing:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Levy collection rate** | 95%+ on time |
| **Meeting frequency** | Regular schedule maintained |
| **Response time** | Owner queries within 7 days |
| **Compliance** | No missed deadlines |
| **Costs** | Within or under budget |

### Annual Review

At each AGM, assess:

- Did self-management work well?
- What improvements are needed?
- Are volunteers still willing?
- Should we continue self-managing?

## Hybrid Options

### Partial Support

You don't have to be fully self-managed or fully managed. Consider:

| Service | Do Yourself | Outsource |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Levy collection | ✓ | Bookkeeper |
| Meetings | ✓ | Occasionally chair |
| Correspondence | ✓ | - |
| Financial statements | ✓ | Accountant prepares |
| Complex issues | - | Consultant |

### Returning to Management

If self-management isn't working:

- It's okay to go back to professional management
- Better to get help than let things deteriorate
- Consider part-time or limited management first

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much can we save?

Typical management fees range from $2,000-$10,000+ per year depending on scheme size. However, factor in costs of tools, professional services, and volunteer time value.

### What if no one wants to be treasurer?

Consider engaging a bookkeeper for the financial work, while committee retains oversight. This reduces individual burden.

### Can we trial self-management?

Yes. Consider a 12-month trial, then assess at AGM whether to continue.

### What's the biggest risk?

Compliance failures from lack of knowledge or attention. Mitigate through training, checklists, and getting professional help when unsure.

### How do we handle disputes without a manager?

Same process—try to resolve informally, use mediation, escalate to Fair Trading or NCAT if needed. A manager doesn't resolve disputes anyway.

## Next Steps

1. **Assess** whether self-management suits your scheme
2. **Review** your current management agreement
3. **Discuss** with committee and identify volunteers
4. **Pass** resolution to terminate (if proceeding)
5. **Plan** detailed transition timeline
6. **Set up** systems before handover
7. **Execute** handover carefully
8. **Review** progress after first year
