# Emergency Repairs in Strata: Who Pays and How to Handle Them

Emergencies don't wait for committee meetings. When a pipe bursts at 2am or the lift breaks down, someone needs to act quickly. This guide explains how to handle emergency repairs properly in your NSW strata scheme.

## What Qualifies as an Emergency?

### Emergency Criteria

An emergency repair is one that:

| Criterion | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Immediate safety risk** | Gas leak, structural collapse risk |
| **Prevents essential services** | No water, power, or lift for mobility-impaired |
| **Will cause significant damage if delayed** | Burst pipe causing flooding |
| **Required by law/authority** | Fire system failure, council order |

### Common Strata Emergencies

| Emergency | Response Needed |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Burst pipe** | Plumber to stop leak, minimise damage |
| **Electrical hazard** | Electrician to make safe |
| **Gas leak** | Gas fitter, may need evacuation |
| **Lift breakdown** | Lift technician (urgent if people trapped) |
| **Fire system failure** | Fire contractor to restore |
| **Security breach** | Locksmith, security to restore access control |
| **Storm damage** | Make safe, prevent further damage |
| **Blocked sewer** | Plumber to clear blockage |

### What's NOT an Emergency

| Situation | Why Not Emergency |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Slow dripping tap** | Nuisance but no immediate risk |
| **Cosmetic damage** | Unsightly but not urgent |
| **Broken amenity** | Pool, gym—inconvenient not critical |
| **Non-functioning light** | Unless it's a safety light |
| **Noise complaint** | Important but not emergency repair |

<Info>
If in doubt whether something is a true emergency, consider: will waiting until tomorrow cause safety issues or significant additional damage?
</Info>

## Who Can Authorise Emergency Work?

### Authority to Act

| Person | Authority |
|--------|-----------|
| **Strata manager** | If contracted for emergency response |
| **Secretary** | Usually first committee contact |
| **Any committee member** | In absence of secretary |
| **Chairperson** | Often delegated authority |
| **Building manager** | If employed and authorised |

### Delegated Authority

The committee should establish clear delegations:

**Emergency Repair Delegation**

The committee delegates authority to:
1. The strata manager (if appointed), or
2. The secretary, or
3. Any available committee member

To authorise emergency repairs up to $[amount] for the purpose of:
- Making the situation safe
- Preventing further damage
- Restoring essential services

<Tip>
Document your delegation in committee meeting minutes with an adoption date for proper governance.
</Tip>

### Spending Limits

Set appropriate limits:

| Scheme Size | Suggested Limit |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Small (< 10 lots)** | $2,000 - $5,000 |
| **Medium (10-50 lots)** | $5,000 - $10,000 |
| **Large (50+ lots)** | $10,000 - $20,000 |

For amounts above the limit, the authorised person should:

- Make the situation safe up to the limit
- Convene urgent committee meeting (can be by phone/email)
- Get retrospective approval if truly urgent

## Responding to Emergencies

### Immediate Steps

1. **Assess safety** - Is anyone in danger?
2. **Call emergency services** - If life-threatening (000)
3. **Isolate if possible** - Turn off water, power at source
4. **Contact authorised person** - Follow your scheme's chain
5. **Engage contractor** - Use emergency contacts
6. **Document** - Photos, times, what happened

### Emergency Contact List

Maintain a current list:

| Service | Contact | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Plumber** | [Name, phone] | 24/7 available |
| **Electrician** | [Name, phone] | Licensed, insured |
| **Locksmith** | [Name, phone] | After-hours available |
| **Lift technician** | [Name, phone] | Per maintenance contract |
| **Fire systems** | [Name, phone] | Per maintenance contract |
| **Building manager** | [Name, phone] | If applicable |
| **Strata manager** | [Name, phone] | If applicable |
| **Committee contacts** | [Names, phones] | Chain of contact |

<Tip>
Display emergency contacts in a common area and ensure all committee members have a copy. Consider a laminated card format.
</Tip>

### What to Tell the Contractor

Provide:

- Address and access details
- Nature of emergency
- Who to contact on arrival
- Where problem is located
- Authority to proceed up to $X
- Request estimate if possible

## Who Pays for Emergency Repairs?

### General Principle

| Repair Location | Who Pays |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Common property** | Owners corporation (admin or capital fund) |
| **Within a lot** | Lot owner |
| **Common property damage from lot** | Initially OC, may recover from lot owner |
| **Lot damage from common property** | OC may be liable, claim on insurance |

### Cost Recovery Situations

The owners corporation may be able to recover costs from:

| Situation | From Whom |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Lot owner caused damage** | That lot owner |
| **Tenant caused damage** | Lot owner (who may pursue tenant) |
| **Contractor negligence** | Contractor |
| **Builder defect** | Builder (if within warranty) |
| **Third party damage** | That party |
| **Covered by insurance** | Insurer |

### Insurance Considerations

For emergency repairs:

| Consideration | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| **Document everything** | Photos, invoices, timeline |
| **Notify insurer early** | Don't wait until claim is ready |
| **Mitigation** | Take steps to prevent further damage |
| **Keep damaged items** | Insurer may want to inspect |
| **Multiple quotes** | May be needed for permanent repairs |

<Warning>
Emergency repairs are typically covered if the cause is insured (e.g., storm damage). The defect itself (e.g., failed waterproofing) may not be covered.
</Warning>

## After the Emergency

### Immediate Follow-Up

| Task | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| **Notify committee** | As soon as practical |
| **Document what happened** | Same day if possible |
| **Collect invoices** | Before payment |
| **Notify affected owners** | If impacts them |
| **Notify insurer** | Within 24-48 hours if potential claim |

### Committee Ratification

At the next committee meeting:

1. **Report** what happened and actions taken
2. **Confirm** emergency status justified actions
3. **Ratify** expenditure if within delegation
4. **Approve** any additional expenditure needed
5. **Consider** permanent repairs required
6. **Review** whether emergency could have been prevented

### Record Keeping

Document for your records:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Incident report** | What, when, where, who |
| **Photos/videos** | Evidence of damage |
| **Contractor invoices** | Payment records |
| **Communications** | Who was contacted |
| **Committee minutes** | Ratification of actions |
| **Insurance correspondence** | Claim documentation |

## Preventing Emergencies

### Proactive Maintenance

Reduce emergencies through:

| Action | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Regular inspections** | Catch problems early |
| **Preventive maintenance** | Stop failures before they happen |
| **Asset registers** | Know what needs attention |
| **Scheduled servicing** | Lifts, fire systems, HVAC |
| **Prompt minor repairs** | Don't let small issues escalate |

### Common Preventable Emergencies

| Emergency | Prevention |
|-----------|------------|
| **Burst pipes** | Regular plumbing inspection, replace aging pipes |
| **Blocked drains** | Regular cleaning, root treatment |
| **Electrical fires** | Periodic electrical inspection |
| **Lift breakdowns** | Maintain service contract, address issues promptly |
| **Fire system failures** | Maintain AFSS compliance |

## Emergency Procedures by Type

### Water Emergencies

1. Locate and turn off water isolation valve
2. Call plumber
3. Remove valuables from affected areas
4. Notify affected lots
5. Document damage
6. Contact insurer

### Electrical Emergencies

1. Do NOT touch anything if water is present
2. Turn off power at switchboard if safe
3. Call licensed electrician
4. Evacuate if fire/smoke risk
5. Call 000 if active fire

### Gas Emergencies

1. Do NOT operate electrical switches
2. Open windows if safe
3. Evacuate the area
4. Call gas emergency line (free call usually on gas meter)
5. Call 000 if immediate danger

### Lift Emergencies

1. If people trapped, call lift technician emergency line
2. Communicate with trapped occupants
3. Do NOT attempt to force doors
4. Call 000 if medical emergency inside
5. Post notices that lift is out of service

### Storm Damage

2. Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage
3. Document all damage
4. Notify insurer
5. Get permanent repair quotes

## Special Considerations

### After-Hours Emergencies

Consider:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Who is contactable** | After-hours roster or contact list |
| **After-hours rates** | Budget for premium rates |
| **Access** | How does contractor get in? |
| **Security** | If security compromised |

### Body Corporate Manager Access

If you have a strata manager:

- Confirm their after-hours emergency response
- Understand their spending authority
- Know how to contact them
- Have backup if they're unavailable

### Self-Managed Schemes

Without professional management:

- Committee emergency roster important
- Clear delegation essential
- Relationships with contractors critical
- May need to build more contingency into budget

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I fix an emergency myself?

For immediate safety (e.g., turning off a tap), yes. For actual repairs, use licensed contractors—DIY can create liability issues.

### What if no committee member is available?

Any owner can take reasonable steps to prevent damage. Document everything and seek ratification as soon as possible.

### Can I be reimbursed if I pay for emergency repairs?

Yes, if the repair was appropriate and you have receipts. Submit to committee for approval and reimbursement.

### What's the excess on emergency claims?

Depends on your policy and claim type. Water damage often has higher excess. Check your PDS.

### Should we have an emergency fund?

Good practice to have accessible funds for emergencies—at least one quarter's levies in a call account.

### How do I know if after-hours rates are reasonable?

After-hours rates are typically 1.5x to 2x normal. Significantly more than this, ask questions. Get regular-hours quotes for comparison if possible.

## Next Steps

1. **Create** or update your emergency contact list
2. **Review** and document spending delegations
3. **Ensure** committee members know the process
4. **Maintain** relationships with reliable contractors
5. **Keep** some funds accessible for emergencies
6. **Review** insurance coverage and understand excess
