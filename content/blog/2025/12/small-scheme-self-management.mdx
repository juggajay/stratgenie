# Self-Managing a Small Strata Scheme (2-10 Lots) in NSW

Small strata schemes—duplexes, triplexes, and small townhouse complexes—are natural candidates for self-management. With just a few owners, professional management fees often seem disproportionate. This guide shows how to make self-management work for your small scheme.

## Why Small Schemes Are Different

### Advantages of Small Schemes

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Fewer owners** | Easier coordination |
| **Lower complexity** | Simpler building systems |
| **Closer relationships** | Better communication |
| **Lower budgets** | Less financial administration |
| **Quicker decisions** | Less bureaucracy needed |

### Challenges of Small Schemes

| Challenge | How to Manage |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Fewer volunteers** | One or two people do most work |
| **Less expertise** | May need to learn as you go |
| **Personality conflicts** | Harder to avoid problem individuals |
| **Cost sharing** | Big expenses hit harder per lot |

<Info>
Many small schemes have been successfully self-managed for decades. The key is good communication and fair sharing of responsibilities.
</Info>

## Simplified Governance

### Committee Requirements

For schemes with 2-3 lots:

- A committee is optional (owners can act collectively)
- If you have a committee, all owners are usually on it
- One person often holds all office-bearer positions

For schemes with 4-10 lots:

- Committee of 3-5 is typical
- Consider rotating positions annually
- Share workload across all willing owners

### Meeting Requirements

**AGM:** Still required annually, but can be simplified:

| Requirement | How to Simplify |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Notice** | Email to all owners (if agreed) |
| **Attendance** | All owners in one room |
| **Voting** | Often unanimous or show of hands |
| **Minutes** | Brief record of decisions |

**Committee meetings:** Can be informal:

- Meet over coffee or online
- Email decisions for simple matters
- Keep written record of all decisions

<Tip>
Even in small schemes, document decisions in writing. This protects everyone and provides a record for future reference.
</Tip>

### Decision Making

In small schemes, decisions often happen by:

- Informal discussion and agreement
- Email consensus
- Quick committee meeting (in person or phone)
- Resolution without meeting (all agree in writing)

**What still needs a general meeting:**

- Annual budget and levies
- Major expenditure (beyond committee authority)
- By-law changes
- Election of committee

## Financial Management

### Typical Small Scheme Budget

Example for a 4-lot townhouse complex:

**Administrative Fund**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Insurance | $6,000 |
| Gardening | $2,400 |
| Cleaning (common) | $600 |
| Utilities (common) | $800 |
| Repairs contingency | $1,200 |
| Administration | $200 |
| **Total Admin** | **$11,200** |
| **Per lot quarterly** | **$700** |

**Capital Works Fund**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Future painting | $1,000 |
| Roof replacement | $500 |
| Driveway reseal | $200 |
| Contingency | $300 |
| **Total Capital** | **$2,000** |
| **Per lot quarterly** | **$125** |

**Total quarterly levy per lot: $825**

### Banking

Keep it simple:

- One bank account is often sufficient
- Track admin and capital works separately (even if same account)
- Use a spreadsheet or simple accounting tool
- Dual signatories for payments over a threshold

### Levy Collection

Options for small schemes:

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Direct transfer** | Simple, free | Manual tracking |
| **BPAY** | Standard, trackable | Setup required |
| **Direct debit** | Automatic | Setup complexity |
| **Cash/cheque** | Simple | No audit trail |

<Warning>
Always give receipts for cash payments and keep good records. Even between neighbours, financial records should be professional.
</Warning>

## Insurance

### What You Need

Even 2-lot schemes need:

| Insurance | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **Building** | Mandatory, covers structure |
| **Public liability** | Covers common area injuries |
| **Office bearers** | Protects committee members |

### Getting Quotes

- Specify "strata scheme" when getting quotes
- Provide accurate building information
- Compare at least 2-3 insurers
- Consider using a broker for guidance

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Underinsured** | Get professional valuation |
| **Premium seems high** | Shop around, check excess options |
| **Not sure what's covered** | Read PDS carefully, ask questions |

## Maintenance

### Dividing Responsibilities

Options for shared maintenance:

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Roster** | Each owner takes turns |
| **Self-manage own areas** | Each maintains adjacent common property |
| **Contractor** | Engage for all maintenance |
| **Combination** | DIY for small, contractor for big |

### Common Area Maintenance

Typical items for small schemes:

| Item | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| **Lawn mowing** | Weekly/fortnightly |
| **Garden beds** | Monthly |
| **Gutter cleaning** | 6-monthly |
| **Common lighting** | As needed |
| **Driveway** | Occasional cleaning, repairs |
| **Fence/boundary** | As needed |

### When to Use Contractors

Use professionals for:

- Anything involving safety risks
- Electrical and plumbing work
- Major painting
- Tree removal
- Structural repairs

<Tip>
Even if an owner is a tradesperson, consider whether they should do the work. Insurance, liability, and relationship issues can arise.
</Tip>

## Communication

### Keeping Everyone Informed

In small schemes, communication is personal:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Face-to-face** | Important discussions |
| **Group chat** | Quick updates, coordination |
| **Email** | Decisions requiring record |
| **Noticeboard** | Contractor visits, reminders |
| **Written notices** | Formal requirements |

### Managing Disagreements

In small schemes, disputes can be particularly difficult because you live so close. Approaches:

1. **Address early** - Don't let issues fester
2. **Focus on issues** - Not personalities
3. **Seek common ground** - Compromise where possible
4. **Use formal process** - If informal fails
5. **Get external help** - Mediation if needed

## Common Small Scheme Issues

### Parking Disputes

| Issue | Resolution Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Visitor parking** | Clear by-law on usage |
| **Allocation disagreement** | Follow strata plan or by-law |
| **Oversized vehicles** | By-law addressing size limits |

### Garden and Landscaping

| Issue | Resolution Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Different standards** | Agree on minimum expectations |
| **Trees causing issues** | Committee decision on management |
| **Who maintains what** | Clear allocation, documented |

### Noise and Lifestyle

| Issue | Resolution Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Noise complaints** | By-law with reasonable hours |
| **Party conflicts** | Direct conversation first |
| **Different schedules** | Mutual respect, compromise |

## When to Get Help

### Professional Support Options

| Need | Who to Engage |
|------|---------------|
| **Financial questions** | Accountant (occasional) |
| **Legal issues** | Strata lawyer |
| **Complex maintenance** | Building consultant |
| **Disputes** | Mediator |
| **Administrative overload** | Part-time administrator |

### Signs You May Need More Help

Consider additional support if:

- Key person is burned out
- Disputes are escalating
- Compliance is slipping
- Building issues are complex
- Nobody wants to take responsibility

## Tools for Small Schemes

### Simple Technology

| Need | Free/Low-Cost Options |
|------|----------------------|
| **Document storage** | Google Drive, Dropbox |
| **Financial tracking** | Excel, Google Sheets |
| **Communication** | Email, WhatsApp group |
| **Levy notices** | Word templates |
| **Calendar** | Google Calendar (shared) |

### When to Use Software

Consider strata software like StrataGenie if:

- You want structured compliance tracking
- Financial tracking is getting complex
- You value having templates and guidance
- Multiple people need to access records

<TrialCTA />

## Two-Lot Schemes (Duplexes)

### Special Considerations

Two-lot schemes have unique characteristics:

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Decision making** | Need agreement or stalemate |
| **Cost sharing** | 50/50 unless different UE |
| **Relationship** | One bad relationship = big problem |
| **Voting** | Tied votes are common |

### Making Decisions

With two owners:

- Most decisions need both to agree
- Chairperson casting vote helps for ties
- May need NCAT intervention for deadlocks
- Good relationship is essential

### Tips for Duplex Owners

1. **Communicate proactively** - Don't assume
2. **Put agreements in writing** - Even informal ones
3. **Maintain boundaries** - Clear about responsibilities
4. **Address issues promptly** - Small things become big
5. **Be willing to compromise** - Neither gets everything

<Warning>
In two-lot schemes, significant deadlocks may require NCAT intervention. Maintain a cooperative relationship where possible.
</Warning>

## Annual Checklist for Small Schemes

### Beginning of Year

- [ ] Review insurance policy and renew
- [ ] Check fire safety requirements
- [ ] Plan any maintenance for the year
- [ ] Review capital works fund adequacy

### Mid-Year

- [ ] Review levy collection (chase arrears)
- [ ] Check common property condition
- [ ] Schedule any seasonal maintenance
- [ ] Address any owner concerns

### Before AGM

- [ ] Prepare financial statements
- [ ] Draft budget for next year
- [ ] Schedule AGM with proper notice
- [ ] Prepare agenda and papers

### After AGM

- [ ] Distribute minutes
- [ ] Update Strata Hub if needed
- [ ] Implement any AGM decisions
- [ ] Elect office bearers (committee meeting)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do small schemes still need AGMs?

Yes. All strata schemes must hold an AGM within 2 months of financial year end, regardless of size.

### Can we skip having a committee?

For 2-3 lot schemes, operating without a formal committee is possible (decisions by all owners). For larger small schemes, a committee makes decision-making easier.

### What if we can't agree on expenses?

Start with what's mandatory (insurance). For discretionary items, try to compromise. If deadlocked, NCAT can make orders, but this should be a last resort.

### Should we have written by-laws?

Yes. Even small schemes benefit from clear by-laws covering common issues like parking, noise, and maintenance. They can be simple but should be registered.

### How do we handle it when one owner wants to sell?

The scheme continues regardless of ownership changes. Provide strata information for the sale, ensure levies are paid to settlement, and welcome the new owner to the scheme.

## Next Steps

1. **Assess** your current arrangements
2. **Agree** on role sharing among owners
3. **Set up** simple systems for records and finances
4. **Document** your processes and decisions
5. **Communicate** regularly and proactively
6. **Review** annually and adjust as needed
