- Clear scope in original quote
- Written approval for any variations
- Agreed rates for additional work
- Regular communication during work

<Info>
Most disputes arise from unclear scope. Invest time upfront in defining exactly what's included and excluded.
</Info>

### Insurance Claims

When contractor work leads to damage:

1. Document the damage
2. Notify your scheme's insurer
3. Request contractor's insurance details
4. Contractor's insurer should cover their liability
5. Your insurer covers your scheme's exposure

## Large Project Management

### For Major Works

Consider:

| Resource | When Needed |
|----------|-------------|
| **Project manager** | Complex projects, multiple trades |
| **Building consultant** | Technical oversight |
| **Quantity surveyor** | Cost management |
| **Principal certifier** | Compliance certification |

### Tender Process

For works over $30,000:

1. Prepare detailed specification
2. Advertise or invite tenders
3. Receive and evaluate submissions
4. Shortlist and interview
5. Committee decision
6. Contract negotiation
7. Award contract

### Progress Payments

For large projects, structure payments:

| Stage | Typical Payment |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Deposit** | 10-20% |
| **Progress claims** | Per milestones (40-60% total) |
| **Practical completion** | To 90-95% |
| **Final (retention)** | 5-10% after defects period |

<Warning>
Never pay ahead of work completed. Retain sufficient funds to cover completing work if the contractor defaults.
</Warning>

|----------|----------|
| **Contracts** | Duration + 7 years |
| **Invoices** | 7 years |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do contractors need their own insurance?

Yes. They should have public liability (minimum $10M recommended) and workers compensation if they have employees. Don't rely on your scheme's insurance to cover contractor liability.

### Can a committee member be a paid contractor?

Yes, but conflict of interest rules apply. The member must declare the conflict and abstain from voting on engaging themselves. Consider whether it's appropriate given the relationship.

### What if the contractor damages common property?

Their public liability insurance should cover it. Document the damage, notify the contractor, and if they don't rectify, claim on their insurance. Your insurance may also respond.

### How do we handle contractor access to private lots?

Coordinate with lot owners. Give reasonable notice, arrange suitable times, and ensure contractors respect private property.

### Should we use owner referrals for contractors?

Recommendations are valuable, but still verify credentials, get competitive quotes, and follow proper process. Personal relationships shouldn't override due diligence.

## Next Steps

1. **Audit** your current contractor list
2. **Verify** credentials and insurance currency
3. **Review** ongoing service agreements
4. **Create** templates for quotes and contracts
5. **Establish** clear approval processes
6. **Document** all contractor interactions
