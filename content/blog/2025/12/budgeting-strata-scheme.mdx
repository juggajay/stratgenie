# How to Create a Strata Scheme Budget in NSW

A well-prepared budget is the foundation of sound strata financial management. It ensures you have funds for day-to-day operations and long-term building maintenance while setting fair levy contributions for all owners.

## Understanding Strata Budgets

### Two Funds, Two Budgets

Every NSW strata scheme must maintain two separate funds:

| Fund | Purpose | Covers |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Administrative fund** | Day-to-day operations | Insurance, cleaning, utilities, repairs |
| **Capital works fund** | Long-term maintenance | Major repairs, replacements, upgrades |

Each fund requires its own budget, and levies must be set to meet both.

For a detailed explanation, see our [Admin Fund vs Capital Works Fund](/blog/admin-fund-vs-capital-works-fund) guide.

### Budget Cycle

| Stage | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| **Prepare draft budget** | 2-3 months before financial year end |
| **Committee review** | 1-2 months before |
| **AGM presentation** | At AGM |
| **Owner approval** | Vote at AGM |
| **Implementation** | New financial year |

## Creating the Administrative Fund Budget

### Step 1: Review Last Year

Start with actual expenses from the previous year:

```
Last year's expenses:
Insurance               $12,000
Cleaning               $10,400
Gardening              $6,500
Utilities              $4,200
Repairs & maintenance  $8,300
Administration         $2,100
Audit/accounting       $1,500
Sundry                 $1,000
                      --------
Total                 $46,000
```

### Step 2: Adjust for Changes

Consider what's different this year:

| Item | Last Year | Change | This Year |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Insurance | $12,000 | +15% increase | $13,800 |
| Cleaning | $10,400 | Same contractor | $10,400 |
| Gardening | $6,500 | New contract +5% | $6,825 |
| Utilities | $4,200 | Inflation +8% | $4,536 |
| Repairs | $8,300 | Expected average | $8,000 |
| Admin | $2,100 | Same | $2,100 |
| Audit | $1,500 | Same | $1,500 |
| Sundry | $1,000 | Contingency | $1,500 |
| **Total** | **$46,000** | | **$48,661** |

### Step 3: Add Contingency

Include a buffer for unexpected items:

| Approach | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Percentage** | 5-10% of total |
| **Fixed amount** | Based on experience |
| **Line item** | In sundry/contingency |

**Budget total with 5% contingency:** $48,661 × 1.05 = $51,094

### Step 4: Calculate Required Levy

Divide by number of lots (simple) or unit entitlements (proportional):

**By unit entitlement:**
```
Total budget: $51,094
Total UE: 1,000
Per UE: $51.09/year
Quarterly per UE: $12.77

Lot with 50 UE: $12.77 × 50 = $638.50/quarter
```

## Creating the Capital Works Fund Budget

### Step 1: Review 10-Year Plan

Your capital works fund plan identifies future needs:

| Item | When | Estimated Cost |
|------|------|----------------|
| Roof replacement | Year 5 | $80,000 |
| Lift refurbishment | Year 7 | $50,000 |
| Painting | Year 3 | $40,000 |
| Carpet replacement | Year 4 | $20,000 |
| Hot water system | Year 6 | $15,000 |

See our [Capital Works Plan Guide](/blog/capital-works-plan-guide) for planning details.

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Contribution

Spread costs over the time until needed:

| Item | Cost | Years | Annual |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Roof | $80,000 | 5 | $16,000 |
| Lift | $50,000 | 7 | $7,143 |
| Painting | $40,000 | 3 | $13,333 |
| Carpet | $20,000 | 4 | $5,000 |
| Hot water | $15,000 | 6 | $2,500 |
| **Total** | | | **$43,976** |

### Step 3: Adjust for Existing Balance

If you already have funds accumulated:

```
Required for all items: $160,000 (over various years)
Current balance: $45,000
Shortfall: $115,000
Annual required: $43,976 (per calculation above)
```

### Step 4: Set the Levy

Calculate per lot contribution:

```
Annual capital works budget: $43,976
Per UE: $43.98/year
Quarterly per UE: $10.99

Lot with 50 UE: $10.99 × 50 = $549.50/quarter
```

## Combined Budget Summary

### Total Levy Calculation

| Fund | Annual | Quarterly (50 UE lot) |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Administrative | $51,094 | $638.50 |
| Capital works | $43,976 | $549.50 |
| **Total** | **$95,070** | **$1,188.00** |

## Budget Presentation Tips

### For the AGM

When presenting the budget:

1. **Compare** to last year's actual
2. **Explain** significant changes
3. **Show** the impact on levy per lot
4. **Relate** capital works to the 10-year plan
5. **Allow** time for questions

<Tip>
Visual aids help. Consider a simple chart showing where the money goes—insurance, cleaning, maintenance, etc.
</Tip>

### Anticipate Questions

Be ready to explain:

- Why insurance increased
- What maintenance is planned
- Why capital works contributions are set at that level
- What happens if we don't fund adequately

## Common Budget Mistakes

### Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Underestimating insurance** | Shortfall mid-year | Get quote before budgeting |
| **No contingency** | Can't handle surprises | Include 5-10% buffer |
| **Ignoring inflation** | Budget insufficient | Factor in CPI increases |
| **Flat capital works** | Big levies later | Use 10-year plan properly |
| **Copying last year** | Misses changes | Review each line item |

### Signs of Budget Problems

Watch for:

- Repeated overspends
- Drawing on capital works for admin
- No year-end surplus
- Increasing arrears
- Deferred maintenance

## Setting Appropriate Levies

### Balancing Considerations

| Factor | Lower Levies | Higher Levies |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Owner reaction | Happy now | May resist |
| Financial health | Risky | Stronger |
| Maintenance | May defer | Properly funded |
| Future levies | May spike | Stable |

### Gradual Increases

If levies need to rise significantly:

- Phase in increases over 2-3 years
- Explain the need clearly
- Show the long-term benefit
- Present alternatives (special levy later vs. higher levies now)

## Budget Monitoring

### Monthly Review

Track actual vs. budget:

| Item | Budget | Actual MTD | Variance |
|------|--------|------------|----------|
| Insurance | $13,800 | $13,800 | - |
| Cleaning | $10,400 | $9,800 | $600 under |
| Repairs | $8,000 | $12,500 | ($4,500) over |

### Quarterly Reporting

Report to committee on:

- Income collected vs. expected
- Major expense variances
- Cash position
- Arrears status
- Capital works progress

### Year-End Review

After year-end:

- Compare actual to budget
- Analyse significant variances
- Use learnings for next year's budget
- Report to AGM

## Tools and Resources

### Budget Templates

Useful tools:

- Spreadsheet templates
- Strata accounting software
- StrataGenie's budgeting features

### Professional Help

Consider engaging:

- Accountant for complex budgets
- Quantity surveyor for capital works costing
- Strata consultant for advice

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if owners vote against the budget?

The committee must continue operating with reasonable levies. Consider adjusting the budget and calling another meeting, or using last year's levies as a starting point.

### Can we run a deficit budget?

You can budget for a deficit if you have accumulated surplus, but ongoing deficits are unsustainable. Eventually, you must balance income and expenses.

### How do we handle inflation?

Build expected inflation into your expense estimates. For longer-term capital works planning, assume 2-3% annual cost increases.

### Should we include GST in the budget?

If your scheme is GST-registered, show expenses excluding GST (as you claim credits). If not registered, show GST-inclusive amounts.

### What's a reasonable contingency percentage?

5-10% of administrative expenses is common. New or older buildings with more unknowns may need higher contingencies.

### How often should we review the capital works plan?

Annually as part of budget preparation. The plan should be professionally updated every 5 years.

## Budget Approval Resolution

Include in your AGM agenda:

> THAT the budget for the year ending [date] be approved, providing for:
>
> (a) Administrative fund contributions totalling $[amount]
> (b) Capital works fund contributions totalling $[amount]
>
> With levies to be paid quarterly in advance based on unit entitlements.

## Next Steps

1. **Gather** last year's actual figures
2. **Review** the 10-year capital works plan
3. **Draft** budgets for both funds
4. **Calculate** levy impact per lot
5. **Present** to committee for review
6. **Prepare** AGM papers with budget
7. **Present** and gain approval at AGM
