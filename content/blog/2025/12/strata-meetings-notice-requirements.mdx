# Strata Meeting Notice Requirements in NSW: Complete Guide

Valid strata meetings require proper notice. Getting it wrong can invalidate your meeting and any resolutions passed. This guide covers all notice requirements for NSW strata schemes.

## Why Notice Requirements Matter

Proper notice ensures:

- **Legal validity** of meetings and decisions
- **Fair participation** for all lot owners
- **Informed voting** on agenda items
- **Protection** against challenges to decisions

<Danger>
Meetings held without proper notice may be invalid. Resolutions passed at invalid meetings can be overturned by NCAT.
</Danger>

## Types of Strata Meetings

NSW strata schemes hold three types of meetings, each with specific notice requirements:

| Meeting Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **Annual General Meeting (AGM)** | Annual review, elections, budget | Once per year |
| **Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)** | Urgent or specific matters | As needed |
| **Committee Meeting** | Day-to-day decisions | As needed |

## AGM Notice Requirements

### Minimum Notice Period

The notice period for an AGM is:

| Scheme Type | Notice Required |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Schemes with 100+ lots** | At least 21 days |
| **All other schemes** | At least 14 days |

<Info>
The notice period starts from when notice is given, not when it's sent. Allow extra time for postal delivery.

## Common Notice Mistakes

| **Incomplete motion text** | Owners couldn't make informed decision |
| **Missing attachments** | Financial statements not provided |

### How to Fix Notice Errors

If you discover a notice error:

1. **Before the meeting** - Issue corrected notice with adequate time
2. **At the meeting** - Adjourn and re-notice properly
3. **After the meeting** - May need to re-hold the meeting

## Electronic Meetings

Since the 2020 amendments, strata schemes can hold electronic meetings:

### Requirements for Electronic Meetings

1. **Notice must state** the meeting is electronic
2. **Technology must allow** all participants to communicate

4. **Technical support** should be available

### Hybrid Meetings

For meetings with both in-person and online attendance:

- Notice must explain both options
- All participants must be able to hear and be heard
- Voting must be accessible to all

| Record | Retention Period |
|--------|------------------|

- [ ] Electronic participation details included (if applicable)

### When Sending Notice

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we give shorter notice if it's urgent?

No. The minimum notice periods are mandatory. If a matter is truly urgent, consider whether the committee can make a decision within its delegated authority, or consult Fair Trading about emergency procedures.

### What if an owner hasn't updated their address?

You must send notice to the address on the strata roll. If it returns undelivered, you've still met your obligation. However, it's good practice to make reasonable efforts to find current contact details.

### Can we add items to the agenda after notice is sent?

Additional items cannot be voted on at the meeting. Owners can raise matters under "general business" for discussion only, but decisions must wait for a properly noticed meeting.

### Do tenants receive meeting notices?

No, unless they are registered on the strata roll as lessees. Owners are responsible for informing their tenants about matters that may affect them.

### What if the secretary makes an honest mistake?

Honest mistakes can still invalidate meetings if owners were prejudiced. It's better to postpone and re-notice correctly than risk invalid decisions.
