# How to Create a 10-Year Capital Works Plan in NSW

A capital works fund plan is essential for every NSW strata scheme. It ensures you have funds available when major repairs and replacements are needed, avoiding sudden special levies and deferred maintenance that costs more in the long run.

## Legal Requirements

### What NSW Law Requires

Under the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015, every owners corporation must:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Prepare a plan** | 10-year capital works fund plan |
| **Review annually** | At each AGM |
| **Fund adequately** | Levies must reflect anticipated expenses |

<Warning>
Failure to maintain an adequate capital works fund can lead to building deterioration, special levies, and potential liability for committee members.
</Warning>

### Plan Review Frequency

| Review Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Annual review** | Every AGM | Update for changes, new information |
| **Professional update** | Every 5 years | Fresh assessment by quantity surveyor |
| **After major works** | As needed | Reflect completed work |

## What to Include

### Building Components

Your plan should cover all major building elements:

**Structural**
- Roof and roof membrane
- External walls and cladding
- Balconies and balustrades
- Foundations (if relevant issues)
- Retaining walls

**Waterproofing**
- Roof membranes
- Balcony waterproofing
- Basement waterproofing
- Planter box linings
- Wet area membranes (common areas)

**Services**
- Lifts and escalators
- Fire safety systems
- Electrical systems
- Plumbing risers
- Hot water systems
- Air conditioning (common areas)
- Security and access systems
- Intercom systems

**Finishes**
- External painting
- Internal painting (common areas)
- Carpets and flooring
- Ceiling finishes
- Wall finishes

**External Areas**
- Driveways and paths
- Car park surfaces
- Fencing and gates
- Swimming pools
- Gardens and landscaping
- Outdoor furniture

### Information for Each Item

For each component, record:

| Field | What to Include |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Description** | Clear identification |
| **Current condition** | Good/Fair/Poor |
| **Expected life** | When replacement needed |
| **Estimated cost** | Current replacement cost |
| **Timing** | Year 1-10 when expense expected |
| **Priority** | Essential/Important/Desirable |

## Preparing the Plan

### Step 1: Building Audit

Start with a thorough inspection:

| Area | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| **Roof** | Condition, age, signs of failure |
| **Exterior** | Paint, cladding, cracks, waterproofing |
| **Structure** | Movement, cracking, corrosion |
| **Common areas** | Finishes, fixtures, wear |
| **Services** | Age, condition, compliance |
| **External** | Surfaces, drainage, landscaping |

### Step 2: Gather Information

Collect documentation:

- Original building specifications
- Previous reports and assessments
- Maintenance history
- Contractor recommendations
- Warranty information
- Previous capital works plans

### Step 3: Estimate Lifespans

Use industry benchmarks as a guide:

| Component | Typical Lifespan |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Roof (tiled)** | 50-70 years |
| **Roof (membrane)** | 15-25 years |
| **External paint** | 10-15 years |
| **Internal paint** | 7-10 years |
| **Carpet** | 10-15 years |
| **Lift refurbishment** | 20-25 years |
| **Hot water systems** | 10-15 years |
| **Fire systems** | 15-20 years |
| **Waterproofing** | 15-25 years |
| **Electrical upgrade** | 25-30 years |

<Tip>
These are averages. Your specific conditions, quality of original construction, and maintenance history affect actual lifespans.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Cost Estimates

Estimate costs for each item:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Get quotes** | Imminent works (1-2 years) |
| **Quantity surveyor** | Comprehensive professional assessment |
| **Industry benchmarks** | Rough planning ($/sqm, $/unit) |
| **Historical costs** | Similar previous works (adjusted for inflation) |

### Step 5: Schedule Timing

Spread works over the 10-year period:

| Consideration | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Urgency** | Safety and compliance first |
| **Dependencies** | Some works must precede others |
| **Cash flow** | Avoid multiple major works in same year |
| **Disruption** | Consider impact on residents |
| **Economies of scale** | Group related works where sensible |

## Sample Plan Format

### Summary Table

```
10-YEAR CAPITAL WORKS FUND PLAN
Strata Plan No. XXXXX

4    | Carpark       |         $45,000
5    | Fire system   |         $35,000
6    | -             |              $0
7    | Roof replace  |        $180,000
8    | Interior paint|         $40,000
9    | HVAC          |         $60,000
10   | Painting      |        $130,000
-----|---------------|---------------
     | TOTAL         |        $650,000

Current balance:           $85,000
Required over 10 years:   $650,000
Annual contribution:       $56,500
```

### Detailed Item Record

For each item, document:

```
ITEM: External Painting
Location: All external surfaces
Current condition: Fair (some peeling, fading)
Last done: 2018
Expected lifespan: 12 years
Next required: 2030 (Year 6)
Estimated cost: $120,000 (2024 dollars)
Inflation-adjusted: $135,000 (2030)
Priority: Important
Notes: Consider colour update. Get multiple quotes.
```

## Funding the Plan

### Calculating Annual Contributions

| Method | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Simple average** | Total over 10 years ÷ 10 |
| **Weighted** | More in early years if fund is low |
| **Matched to timing** | Higher before major works |

### Example Calculation

```
Total 10-year requirement:        $650,000
Current fund balance:              $85,000
Net funding needed:               $565,000
Over 10 years:                     $56,500/year
Quarterly levy (10 lots, equal):    $1,412/lot
```

### Adjusting for Inflation

Build in cost increases:

| Approach | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Apply to estimates** | Inflate future costs by 3%/year |
| **Apply to contributions** | Increase levy by 3%/year |
| **Combination** | Inflate estimates, review annually |

<Info>
Construction costs often rise faster than general inflation. Budget conservatively to avoid shortfalls.
</Info>

## Using Quantity Surveyors

### When to Engage a QS

Consider professional help for:

- Initial plan preparation
- Every 5 years for updates
- Complex buildings
- After significant changes
- Before major works

### What a QS Provides

| Deliverable | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| **Condition assessment** | Professional evaluation |
| **Cost estimates** | Accurate, current rates |
| **Lifecycle analysis** | Remaining useful life |
| **Funding model** | Contribution calculations |
| **Priority recommendations** | What to do when |

### Typical Costs

| Scheme Size | Approximate Fee |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Small (< 20 lots)** | $2,000 - $5,000 |
| **Medium (20-50 lots)** | $4,000 - $8,000 |
| **Large (50-100 lots)** | $7,000 - $15,000 |
| **Complex/large** | $15,000 + |

## Annual Review Process

### At Each AGM

1. **Present** current plan to owners
2. **Report** on any works completed
3. **Update** for changed circumstances
4. **Adjust** levy contributions if needed
5. **Record** any owner feedback

### When to Update the Plan

Update immediately if:

- Major works completed (remove from future)
- New issue discovered (add to plan)
- Significant cost change (revise estimate)
- Building modification (affects components)
- Warranty claim successful (reduces cost)

## Common Mistakes

### Planning Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Underestimating costs** | Shortfall when needed | Use professional estimates |
| **Ignoring inflation** | Real value erodes | Build in escalation |
| **Missing items** | Surprise expenses | Comprehensive audit |
| **Wishful lifespans** | Funds not ready | Be realistic about timing |
| **No contingency** | Can't handle unexpected | Include 10-15% buffer |

### Funding Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Low levies** | Special levies needed | Fund properly from start |
| **Using for admin** | Capital works underfunded | Maintain separation |
| **Not reviewing** | Plan becomes outdated | Annual review at AGM |
| **Ignoring the plan** | Works deferred, costs rise | Use plan to guide decisions |

## Connecting Plan to Budget

### Using the Plan

Your capital works fund plan should directly inform:

| Budget Item | How Plan Informs |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Capital works levy** | Total needed over 10 years |
| **Timing of works** | When to get quotes |
| **Tender timing** | Start process before needed |
| **Reserve balance** | Target fund level |

### Budget Presentation

At AGM, show owners:

```
Capital Works Fund Status

Opening balance:                 $120,000
Current year contributions:       $45,000
Works completed this year:       ($35,000)
Closing balance:                 $130,000

10-year funding requirement:     $650,000
Current balance:                 $130,000
Years 1-10 contributions needed: $520,000
Annual contribution required:     $52,000
Recommended levy increase:            15%
```

## Prioritising Works

### Priority Categories

| Priority | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Essential** | Safety, compliance, prevent major damage | Fire systems, structural repairs |
| **Important** | Prevent deterioration, maintain function | Waterproofing, painting |
| **Desirable** | Improvement, amenity | Landscaping upgrades, aesthetic improvements |

### Decision Framework

When resources are limited:

1. **Safety first** - Address any immediate hazards
2. **Compliance** - Meet legal requirements
3. **Prevent escalation** - Fix before worse
4. **Maintain value** - Protect asset condition
5. **Enhance** - Improvements last

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if we can't afford recommended contributions?

You have options: phase increases over several years, prioritise essential works, accept risk of special levies later, or consider strata finance.

### Can we spend capital works funds on anything?

Capital works funds should only be used for capital purposes (major repairs, replacements). Not for day-to-day administrative expenses.

### What if an item lasts longer than expected?

Good news! Update your plan to reflect the extended life, potentially reducing near-term contributions.

### How detailed should the plan be?

Detailed enough to guide decisions and funding. Every significant building component should be included with realistic costs and timing.

### Who prepares the plan?

The committee is responsible. You can prepare it yourselves or engage a quantity surveyor for professional preparation.

## Next Steps

1. **Audit** your building's major components
2. **Gather** historical information and specifications
3. **Estimate** costs and timing for each item
4. **Calculate** required annual contributions
5. **Present** to AGM and set levies
6. **Review** annually and update as needed
7. **Consider** professional QS review every 5 years
