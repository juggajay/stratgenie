## 3. Readability Standards & Thresholds

Readability directly impacts user engagement, time on page, and ultimately rankings. Our target audience is volunteer strata committee members (non-technical).

### 3.1 Core Readability Metrics

| Metric | Target Range | Tool | Threshold |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Flesch Reading Ease | 60-70 | Hemingway, Yoast | Minimum 55 |
| Grade Level | 8-10 | Hemingway | Maximum Grade 12 |
| Average Sentence Length | 15-20 words | Word count / sentence count | Maximum 25 words |
| Passive Voice | <10% of sentences | Hemingway, Grammarly | Maximum 15% |
| Complex Words | <10% of total words | Readable.com | Maximum 15% |
| Paragraph Length | 2-4 sentences | Manual count | Maximum 5 sentences |

### 3.2 Structural Readability Standards

#### Heading Hierarchy
- ✅ **One H1 per page** (title only)
- ✅ **H2 every 300-500 words** (major sections)
- ✅ **H3 for subsections** (break up H2 sections)
- ✅ **H4 sparingly** (only for deeply nested topics)
- ❌ **Never skip levels** (H2 → H4)

#### Content Formatting
- **Paragraph Length:** 2-4 sentences (40-80 words)
- **Sentence Length:** Mix of short (5-10 words), medium (15-20 words), and occasional long (25-30 words)
- **Lists:** Use bullets or numbers for 3+ related items
- **Bold/Emphasis:** Highlight 1-2 key phrases per section (not entire sentences)
- **White Space:** Empty line between every paragraph

#### Visual Content Requirements
- **Frequency:** One visual element every 300-500 words
- **Types:** Images, tables, charts, infographics, callout boxes
- **Image Alt Text:** Descriptive, includes keyword where natural (under 125 characters)
- **Tables:** Use for comparisons, data, step-by-step processes
- **Callout Boxes:** For warnings, tips, key takeaways (use custom components: `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`, `<Danger>`)

### 3.3 Scannability Checklist

Users scan before they read. Ensure content passes the "5-second test."

| Element | Requirement | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Descriptive Subheadings | Every 200-300 words | User can understand structure from headings alone |
| Front-Loaded Information | Key info in first 100 words | Answers "what" and "why" immediately |
| Bullet Points | Present in every article | Breaks up text, easy to scan |
| Numbered Lists | For processes, steps, rankings | Clear sequence, easy to follow |
| Bold Key Phrases | 1-2 per major section | Draws eye to important concepts |
| Table of Contents | Articles >1500 words | Allows jumping to relevant sections |
| Summary/TLDR | Articles >2000 words | Quick takeaways at top or bottom |
| Internal Links | 3-5 per article | Context without leaving page |

**Scannability Test:**
1. Can a user understand the main points by reading only headings?
2. Are key takeaways visible without reading full paragraphs?
3. Is there sufficient white space to avoid "wall of text"?
4. Do visual elements break up long sections?

### 3.4 Mobile Readability Standards

Over 60% of users will read on mobile. Ensure mobile-first readability.

| Element | Mobile Standard | Why It Matters |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Font Size | Minimum 16px | Readable without zooming |
| Line Height | 1.5-1.8 | Prevents lines running together |
| Paragraph Width | Maximum 70 characters | Optimal reading line length |
| Touch Targets | Minimum 48x48px | Easy to tap links/buttons |
| No Horizontal Scroll | Responsive images/tables | Frustrating UX killer |
| Loading Speed | <2.5 seconds (LCP) | User retention, SEO factor |

### 3.5 Accessibility Standards

Readability includes accessibility for users with disabilities.

| Standard | Requirement | How to Check |
|----------|------------|--------------|

| Table Headers | `<th>` used for table headers | HTML validator |
| Video Transcripts | Provided for all video content | Manual check |

**WCAG Compliance Level:** AA minimum (target AAA where possible)

### 3.6 Content Length Guidelines

|--------------|---------------|---------|---------|

| Listicles | 1,000-2,000 words | 800 | 3,000 |
| FAQ Pages | 800-1,500 words | 500 | 2,000 |
| News/Updates | 500-1,000 words | 300 | 1,500 |

**Length Determination Factors:**
- **Search Intent:** Informational = longer, navigational = shorter
- **Competitor Analysis:** Match or exceed top 3 results by 20-30%
- **Topic Complexity:** More complex = more words needed
- **User Needs:** Answer all questions comprehensively

### 3.7 Reading Level Guidelines by Content Type

| Content Type | Target Audience | Reading Level | Flesch Score |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Compliance Guides | Strata committee members | Grade 8-9 | 60-70 |
| Financial Content | Committee treasurers | Grade 9-10 | 55-65 |

| Technical Docs | Strata managers, professionals | Grade 10-11 | 50-60 |

**Simplification Techniques:**

- Use examples and analogies for complex concepts
