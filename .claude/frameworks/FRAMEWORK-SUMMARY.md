## Framework at a Glance

### Content Scoring System

Content is evaluated across 6 weighted dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Key Criteria |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Content Value & Relevance | 25% | Comprehensive coverage, unique insights, user value |
| 2. Technical SEO Optimization | 20% | Keywords, meta tags, links, schema markup |
| 3. Readability & UX | 20% | Flesch score 60-70, formatting, scannability |
| 4. E-E-A-T Signals | 20% | Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness |
| 5. Content Freshness | 10% | Current info, 2025 data, updated best practices |
| 6. Engagement & Conversion | 5% | Clear CTAs, user journey, conversion paths |

**Overall Score = Weighted sum of all dimensions**

**Formula:**
```
Score = (Value × 0.25) + (SEO × 0.20) + (Readability × 0.20) +
        (E-E-A-T × 0.20) + (Freshness × 0.10) + (Engagement × 0.05)
```
