## PRIORITY MATRIX

#2-5 declining         | → URGENT (1-2wks) | → HIGH (30d)

#16+ stable            | → MEDIUM (60d)    | → LOW (6mo)
Evergreen stable       | → MEDIUM (60d)    | → BATCH
```

## PRIORITY SCORE FORMULA

```
Score = (Decay × Traffic Weight) + (Opportunity × ROI)

Decay Score: 1-10 (from signal detection)
Traffic Weight: 0.5x to 2.0x based on monthly visits
Opportunity: Gap vs competitors + ranking potential
ROI: Expected traffic/conversion gain ÷ effort hours

Score 18+: URGENT (1-2 weeks)

## ROI QUICK CALCULATION

```
ROI = (Revenue Generated - Cost) / Cost × 100%

Simple Formula:
Extra traffic × $value per visitor ÷ refresh hours = ROI

Example:
- 3-hour refresh at $75/hr = $225 cost
- Generated 90 extra visits/month
- 2% conversion at $50 value = $1/visit
- $90/month × 12 months = $1,080/year revenue
- ROI: ($1,080 - $225) / $225 = 380% ROI

Payback Period: $225 cost ÷ ($1,080÷12) = 2.5 months
```

3. **Engagement Rate**

7. Core Web Vitals

### Timeline

## BEST PRACTICES CHECKLIST

- [ ] Always collect baseline metrics before refresh

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Over-refreshing stable content** → Monitor only if it's decaying
2. **Broken links after update** → Test all links before publishing
3. **Search intent mismatch** → Check current SERP before updating
4. **Missing freshness signals** → Always update dateModified & visible date
5. **No ROI tracking** → Measure before and after at 1mo, 3mo, 6mo
6. **Updating publish date** → Keep original, only update dateModified
7. **Forgetting supporting content** → Refresh content clusters together
8. **Adding heavy media** → Optimize images/video for Core Web Vitals
9. **Competitor content gaps** → Research top 5 SERP results before updating
10. **Ignoring seasonal timing** → Refresh 6-8 weeks before peak season
